# Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling on User Review Dataset
This is an unsupervised learning project to clustered customer reviews into groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.
## Dataset
Aan e-commerce product review data from http://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html.
## Steps
- Preprocessing review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF).
- Training unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis.
- Identifying latent topic and keywords of each review for clustering.
