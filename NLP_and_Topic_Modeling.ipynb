            "Scratches, i love this watch for my purpose, about the people complaining should of done their research better before buying. dumb people., I was about to buy this thinking it was a Swiss Army Infantry watch-- the description uses the words infantry and army--- when I realized it must be a fraud for $12.00. This should not be offered on Amazon-- it is designed to confuse consumers., Great quality and build.<br />The motors are really silent.<br />After fiddling with the settings my watches are always charged and ready to use., I bought this watch on 2013, the screen had a problem 10 months later. I sent the watch back to Casio Service Center in LA, they sent to me a replacement new watch. Last week, less than one year after I received the new watch, the battery is out.  I went to a shop to replace the battery. Then the A button of the watch do not working, so I could not change the time and other settings. I do not think this watch is a good product. Do not buy it., Heavier than i though, Had it for several weeks now and I love it - reliable, functional, wears easy, not too heavy.  I also get a lot of comments on it - great watch!, The watch is attractive and easy to read, except for the date. The little diamonds are very, very tiny. All in all, I'm happy with it., said my wife.., Nice watch, on time delivery from seller., Just what I needed for my Timex watch. Fits perfect on my wrist, Its too large. When you order check the size of the case., Thought that I read somewhere that you could swim with it. It does not however bear the 50M Water Resistance designation., This watch is a very beautiful time piece. This also could be an alternative choice to a Rolex submariner. It also has the same features as a Rolex submariner but it's not as good as a Rolex watch but darn close.<br /><br />Take good care of this watch if you get one because it has gold plating on it. This watch is 'Not' a sport watch.<br /><br />This watch features<br />-Rotating timer dial<br />-All stainless steel (kinda heavy)<br />-Glow in the dark<br />-Water resistant to 200 meters (600 feet)<br />-Automatic winding (from wrist movements)<br />-Shows date<br />-Very beautiful<br /><br />Sizeing isn't difficult, I sized mine by using a thumbtack and a hammer to tap the pins out of the band and I tapped a pin back into the band after removing three band links. If you don't know what your doing then just take it to s jewelry store so they can size it for you, This is a beautiful watch. I love the look and feel of it, and I get complimented on it all the time. If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model. When I think of it that way, it's not quite so disappointing., [[VIDEOID:cc599be25462207f860e42621171d7e1]]This watch has an understated clean and classy design.  It looks elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 7.5\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8\\\\\".<br /><br />The face of the watch is 1 3/16\\\\\" wide and the watch is 1/4\\\\\" thick. The back of the watch states it has Japanese quartz movement.  The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.  It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and include a gift bag.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI for review.  Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I leave critical reviews as well as positive reviews like this one.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, Awesome watch for the price, Nice face, easy to read. The band is a little too small., crap, This is now my everyday watch.  Easy to read with lots of features.  Light  and functional.  You can not beat the price.  It is clean in detail and I love the watch., amazing product keeps everything safe and secure organized great quality for my designer belts perfect for homes or traveling, Metal color was changed after the first use , which indicates a very poor quality, Great product . Love the continous innovation in this field and given the price-tag of $149, this product is a steal . Bought it 1 week back . Battery is satisfactory . Charges fast . Discharges within 12-15 hours . But it has a touch screen, so naturally its going to eat-up battery. For entry level android-wear, pretty decent, A very beautul and well-made pilots watch. Highly detailed dial,as well. The movement is tack- on for 24 hours but if you are not a ditch digger,wind it 20 revs  daily., It was bad it didnt fit my 22mm retro casio, Alrighty, after seeking out the ultimate low-profile, ultra water resistant, mechanical watch with a rotating bezel and date for less than $100, I settled on this.<br /><br />It looks much like the famous Rolex Submariner, and performs similarly.<br /><br />However, after about a year of use now, the paint on the bezel is chipping, and after a decent smack on the hood of a car the crystal has cracked and all but shattered.<br /><br />It keeps time fairly well, gaining about 15 seconds per day, without taking it to a healer for fine tuning., Not bad but a little tacky. It does have substantial weight for a $15 watch., It's a nice watch but if you have a large arm it will not fit  well.  does good under water I use when I go to water aerobic to keep tack of my time, Man watch for woman, just a right size and design for it., I have many Baby-G's, but none have gotten as much attention and compliments as this one. The glitter pops out at everyone and the silver makes it look feminine and sleek. I paid $120 for it, wayy more than I usually pay for Baby-G's, but I think it was worth it, especially since it's a special Japanese model. Probably won't see many people with this watch making it pretty unique. I like the background light is a light blue color, goes well with the color of the watch., The watch as expected was an amazing product from citizen, however the the cover was in a damaged condition which was quite upsetting since I was planning to gift this to some one., This is junk.  Why would you name a watch an ironkid watch if it isn't made for swimming (last time I checked an ironman consisted of swim, bike and run)?  It claims it is water resistant but the watch leaks and it will die if your kid wears it in a pool.  Don't waste your money., Lens cracked on the third day, This is a very nice watch, i love that it's made of wood but black in color. The face is big and has three silver, decorative yet functional dials. It's extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. It's so lightweight you could actually forget you're wearing it. The wood is very smooth and the semi-matte finish is very dressy.<br />The links move easily and is worn without catching or squeezing skin/hair. It's easy to adjust so it will fit a variety of  wrist sizesI love that it's water proof because although very dressy it can be worn for every day use.<br />This would make a great gift for any man in your life.<br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own., So pretty, strap is so soft, easy pliable rubber material. Unfortunately, bezel does not turn. But I recommend this for everyday nursing use., the band broke in first week, Disappointed by the huge size of it, although yes they say in the specs it's a 52&#34; etc...<br />Sent it back. The taxes and p&p cost made me pay for it again., Cool, first:<br />i received watch in good condition, however he battery was not working and i changed the battery<br />second:<br />i tried the watch to my hand but unfortunately was not amazing, it is for old ppl more than youth. i am looking to change the model .<br />i dont know if i can change irt from guess agent in Scotland/Edinburgh or not., This is my 3rd Hadley Roma leather watch band. Others lasted 3+ years. Great quality and design at a good price., heavier than expected, I got this watch on June 8th . I wore it for three weeks and the watch band fell apart. I called Amazon about the repair and was told  I had to call the seller as the warranty does not cover the band. I have never  had a ceramic watch band thus  I  have never had this problem. The watch is beautiful but it servers no purpose if the band is no good. I will try to call the seller for repair., This is an impressive timepiece that's ready for the business world., This product really surpassed my expectation. It was able to perform very well for me. I used it for my US Army Basic training and AIT. It never disappointed me and it was able to remain sturdy even after a series of rugged use. I highly recommend this product., It is so cheap and gaudy, I will never wear it.  It was misrepresented in the picture and description. The picture is darling but the real thing is beyond cheap.  It will go into the thrift shop donation pile., handy, Love fits good use it every day., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, The photo provided of this watch badly distorts the color of the band, which is in fact much lighter than pictured. It is so light, in fact, that it practically blends into my skin when wearing it. But, I can just replace it for a few bucks, right? Wrong. Skagen apparently uses a proprietary design for their watch bands, and they also don't sell replacements to third party dealers. As far as I can gather I would have to send the watch to them and pay whatever sum they demand just to get a reasonable-looking band.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation: Do not buy this watch, or any other produced by Skagen for that matter., Battery or watch died less than 2 days after opening., Had it 2 mos and the battery dies. do they think i'm going to send it in for warranty or just go get a new battery. It must have been sitting around for years for the battery to go bad that quick. Buyer beware : great watch old battery, 10 years old loved it.  Easy to use, water resistant, alarm, chronograph and has a light., perfect! everything as expected! Thank you!, My son loves it!!! Many great features, he said it is super comfortable, I would recommend it to everyone!!, I love this watch! Aside from being cheap, this watch fits perfectly my son's wrist. My first purchase was the gray one. Then I purchased blue for my husband. Now I'm planning to buy one for myself. It has a simple design and the size and thickness is just enough on my wrist. I really love this watch!, The watch is practical, stylish and very reasonably priced., Great watch, really pretty, NOT water resistant. This claims that you can even wear it in the shower... however, one day of wearing it in rainy weather and the face is foggy. Other than that, I LOVE this watch., Horrible watch. Don't buy. The crown came.off after one year with minimum use., Fantastic if you need a watch and have Android phone. If i didn't want to wear a watch i'm not sure i would need it. Keep you from getting you phone out so much for new updates and texts and such. i like being able to change faces and colors. i'm just starting to download games and apps for it.battery life is one waking day. charger is cool., Perfect watch for my elk hunt.  Rugged.  Big.  Non-glare.  Amazing backlight.  Super light.  Super comfortable. Perfect!!!  Thanks Amazon/Casio., handsome watch. hands are a bit difficult to read., After two months of careful wear the cap/screw that holds the wristband pin fell off (and was lost) - and being that I have missed the 30 day sellers return deadline I now have a pretty much brand new yet useless watch!, Good quality with a reasonable price, I wish it was less manly looking (yes, I know it is a man's watch), and I wish that you had the capability of setting two different countdowns, as I use this for work breaks, but I'm still pretty happy with the features., This watch stops working if left on dresser for over 2/3 hours. This is happening since it was bought. I am not sure if it is the issue with battery or something else. after giving a few shake it get back its life and there is a need to reset time date etc. NOT worth the time. Certainly it is very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone this watch., I was hesitant to buy this watch at first after reading the reviews about the band being too small. Now after receiving it I find that it fits me perfect! (By the way my wrist is not skinny). I work at a jewelry counter where we sell watches and this watch's band seems to be the average length of a normal digital woman's watch. Anyways, I'm happy with it., I got a deal on this watch at a local department store, but after I got home and read the reviews, my guard was up already. Well, less than a week into wearing it, I took it off tonight and my wrist was green. Ugh! Frustrating! These US Polo watches have great style and weight in a lot of cases, I just wish they would up the price by about $20 and put some real quality into them, like genuine stainless steel!  Some of the other issues I noticed include: pulling the crown stern in and out moved the entire movement inside the watch, the analog and digital times were off by more than five seconds within a week, the stopwatch time was hard to see in most lighting conditions, and, as others have undoubtedly mentioned, the bezel doesn't actually rotate. I don't expect much for the low price these watches are sold at, but several of those problems I listed are real deal breakers in my book, so back it goes tomorrow., nice but it's a really noisy watch.<br />you will hear it all time... literally every second ..., The strap was well made, however, I had ordered black and it was a dark brown.  Returned for a refund which I received quite promptly., I love it. I did not know that it glows in the dark. That was a nice surprise., muy buen producto, My wife really likes the cool blue silicon wristband and watch face on this Armitron sports watch. It's stylish and fun. It has many holes for adjustment, so even very small wrists should find the proper adjustment (our four year old could wear it comfortably). The setup was fairly simple and standard, with two time zones able to be set, a stopwatch, countdown timer, and alarm. The weekdays on the display are very tiny to read, and makes the display seem a little cluttered or crowded. It is easily visible under water, with little to no glare, and seems a solid sports watch with no frills. While you can wear it in pools and the ocean, you can pretty much predict that if you do that often, the bands will degrade and discolor--but then again that's why you wear your sports watch and not a nice one. Also sunscreens etc, are unfriendly to watch faces and bands., I wasn't expecting much for the price....It came on kind of a cheap necklace type chain, but the watch itself was actually a lot nicer than I had ever expected., I am very happy with this purchase.  I have had it for a month and have used it to adjust the length of 4 watches so far.  Very good quality.  Easy to use.  I have saved a lot of money by not having to take my watches to the jewelers to have them shorten the watch bands.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone.  Delivered on time and without problems., I got this for my daughter for her 7th birthday and she was so excited. She has worn it everyday since receiving it. The watch fits her perfectly, with plenty of room to grow.It looks different from different angles, this makes her so ecstatic.she told me that this was the best gift she'd ever received., Gift for someone, I cant really comment on it., Great watch! I've had the watch for almost 4 years with no complaints. Looks great, really durable, first battery lasted over 2 years. The light works great and sometimes you'll need it during the day to read the time. The all black can be a little hard to read at times, but the light will is sufficient to help out. Worth every penny!, Battery died in 2 weeks!!!!!!!, I really wanted to love this watch but I don't.  Compared to the women's Timex Ironman Triathlon watch it is replacing:<br />1.  The watch is much heavier and bigger.  I really notice the bulk and weight on my wrist when I'm working out<br />2.  The date display is goofy.  The year is displayed first.  Duh - who doesn't know what year it is?  The month/date has a small display which is difficult to read at times.  I went all through the instructions to see if I could change this, but could not.  The Ironman defaults to DAY of week then the DATE of month.  That's what I need, and I need it to be displayed clearly.  Done.<br />3.  The display of the Casio can be difficult to read in bright light conditions.  I don't know if it's my sunglasses, the glare, or what.  But I don't have the same problem with my Ironman watch.<br />4.  This watch is double the price of the Timex Ironman.<br /><br />I prefer the lighter/smaller Timex with easier to read display for half the cost.  My Casio is collecting dust on my shelf, although I will admit it looks nicer than the Timex sitting there., I've had it a month so far.  It's not as high quality as the old one but I like the design.  Very convenient as a bedside alarm.  I find it loud enough, contrary to other reviews.  Quality is okay., Had not noticed that this is the very large watch face and band. I like the watch face fine though it's bigger than I anticipate. Silicone band seems cheap and it's stiff. Put on a leather band that I had for my other watch which was a smaller size, but made the band work ok., Bought this watch in 2014 and wear it at least 75% of the time including in the shower, running, hiking, kayaking, swimming, and all other sorts of activity. It only recently &#34;broke&#34;. Honestly, the circle piece of the face came off, but the watch still functions perfectly. Picture shows what I am talking  about. Purchasing another one and hoping it will last another 3 years!, Not what I expected...., coolest watch ever, Amazing, Too tight., It pains me to rate this watch with 1 star because I love the way that it looks and wears, but if I'm being honest with you and myself, it's a P.O.S.  I'm not a watch snob, in fact this is the most expensive watch that I've ever purchased ($190) and it's been the worst experience I've ever had with a watch. I purchased from the seller Area Trend on Amazon so I can only assume that it's an authentic Luminox but wouldn't be surprised to learn that it's a fake/knock-off/refurbished. When it arrived it wasn't running...Tap it and it would start running...a few hours it would stop again.  I sent it back and they sent me a new one (I had to pay for shipping and wait a couple weeks).  About 3 months later the exact same thing begins to happen...stop periodically and start back for a few hours.  Rather than send it back to wait several weeks and pay shipping again, I took it to a watch repair shop thinking maybe it's a bad battery connection but I find out that it is a faulty mechanism and required a new one.  My watch repairman orders a new mechanism from Luminox and installs it for about $65. Here we are at about 10 months later (owned the watch for a total of about 15 months) and I look down at the watch and the second hand has fallen off and is shaking around loose under the crystal. I'll take it to the watch repairman again, get him to fix it again, wear the hell out of it till it screws up again, but I would never buy this watch again.  Very disappointed in what I thought was going to be a cool watch to own., The smile on my significant others face was worth the cost the watch was prefect better then I expected, Better quality than picture sugests..., Happy with product, Perfect size, light weight, and matches almost everything. A negative is it ticks loudly., Pretty much what I wanted, disappointed with the band. Very stiff, and the end was squared. Hard to feed through buckle., Gorgeous watch! Works fantastic. The dial is of the right size for my not so monstrous hands (7&#34; diameter at wrist - Left Hand), if you have big arms, this may look tiny. The two tone double lock metal strap is gorgeous. It has polished center links with brushed finish links on either side. I had to remove 3 links to fit well on my wrist. There are 5 more links that can be removed to fit ones wrist (so a total of 8 links can be removed to fit ones needs). Hope this gives you an idea of the range of wrist sizes this can fit. I love the big Yellow stop watch arm. All are screw in buttons and knobs, what I mean by that is, you have to unscrew the rings by the two buttons at the top and bottom and the ring at the center knob to make it work. Once you are done using the knob and the buttons make sure to screw back the rings tight, this I suppose makes it water tight. The small dial on the left is your seconds dial, the one at the bottom is your alarm and the one at the top is your stop watch dial. Surprisingly all of the arms fall right on the marker lines when they work, may be I got lucky or may be the quality of the product is that good...I don't know! The hour/minute arms and the main dial has fluorescence on them to aid in visibility in dark surroundings. I have owned this for little over 2 weeks now! The dial is supposed to be used to measure 7 or 8 different parameters, I haven't had a chance to do any of that...Sorry! I have to say at least three others in my work place have bought this piece in the past 2 weeks since they saw this on me!, I was very disappointed that the &#34;illumination&#34; is limited to the teeny tiny little LED section of the watch face.  Not useful at all for nigh time display., Recommended ..., Automatic movt,mop dial,open heart,44 diamonds,butterfly clasp,and on. This was an anniversary gift for my wife. The diamonds may be small but in the light- WoW ., Excellent watch for the money. Sharp understated design. Particularly good if you have a smaller wrist. Hard to find a Chronograph for small wristed. This one fits well!, Awesome and Quick..Thx, Beautifull watch im very happy with this piece actually i want the 1020 model, is the same white instead orange, The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., Very eyecatching obviously.  I found the back of the watch to have a bunch of different metal pieces which uncomfortably dug into my skin.  The weight of the watch, while noticeable, is not unbearable.  The band got quite discolored around the area of the clasp.  Mine is grayish black now besides being orange., Beautiful watch that is even nicer in real life. When first received placed on window sill for about two hours and has worked great since. Strap doesn’t pull arm hair and fit great right out of the box. My only issue is that the hands or numbers are not luminous. This was an oversight by me and should have checked before I ordered but no fault of Amazon or seller so they shouldn’t incur the cost of shipping to exchange. Overall a good buy just do more research before you order to be sure what you select has all options wanted or needed.I plan on keeping as everything else is perfect., This band fits my watch well and I expect it to last a very long time., The crown and stem fell out within 48 hours. The replacement watch HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM! So very disappointed with this model, which is a shame., Good quality band but it is about a half inch too short.  I can use it as is but it would be comfortable if it were a bit longer., Amazon sent me a broken one which I returned. These subaqua specialty watches are normally very good though!, I like the watch but I don't like the buckle on the watchband.  It's cheap plastic.  It would be better if it was made of metal.  Also, when searching for a replacement watch band, it is impossible to find a better upgrade.  All I could find to replace the band with, if I ever had to, was the exact same cheap band that it came with.  If not for the crappy band, I would have given this watch a 5 star rating., So far I have used the watch for a week. Looks clean and simple to use. The weather function is simple and on point so far. The band is comfortable and holds nicely without the end falling out of the loop. Havent used all the other functions yet, so I couldnt rate this watch five stars., The band is super small...the watch head-is much bigger-I really help-the band would fit the &#34;watch&#34; size...A bigger band would make it more appealing...for the price-you would think the band would be larger.., Amazing watch, Love every aspect of this thing and especially for its price. So worth it., It's not really blue at all..., Love this watch. I actually purchased it for my son. It’s awesome., This automatic watch keeps great time when worn regularly or placed on a winder. Holds time for at least 48 hours. It looks great....face is a darker blue than pictured under normal light conditions, but a bright blue in direct sunlight. The upper crown controls only the day of week, which can be set in English or Spanish. The upper crown screws down, but not as securely as the main crown.<br /><br />My only knock is that the band pinches the skin and hair on my wrist... plus it has that unsightly dolphin emblem. Do yourself a favor and either buy this watch with the metal band or replace the one that comes with it. I replaced it with a metal band for less money than it would have cost to buy it that way., I'm preparing to do my clinical rotation next month and this is a great, inexpensive watch for me to help take vital signs manually, such as tracking  pulse and respiration measurements using the second hand.  The interface of the watch is big and clear so I can keep track of the seconds without having to squint my eyes closely at the watch.  In addition, the company was very responsive when I reported that my watch had a stain on the interface, which they quickly replaced for me with a new one that came in a week later.  The band is kind of stiff, however the resourcefulness of the watch to help me take manual vital sign measurements is more of an important purchasing factor for me., A bit flimsey, I've been wearing versions of this watch for about 20 years.  It's easy to use, easy to see the display, comfortable, reliable, and affordable. The small &#34;downside&#34; is that this watch is very ordinary.  Like the title says, it's the Corolla of watches., awesome!!!, Cute watches for the prices. They are huge so if you have a small wrist you'll need to get some links removed ., The time knob is difficult to operate. The design could and should be improved., All of the G-Shock watches are great. This particular one is of the same quality. They are very hardy watches and can withstand a beating. Definitely a good buy for this price., This watch is just awesome.., only used two days, one of the lug was broken., This is a great watch and I very much enjoy wearing it. I wear it almost all the time unless I am working in the yard or doing something where I wouldn't want it scratched or damaged, though I have no reason to believe this watch can't handle almost any situation. The black light does illuminate the number dial sufficiently, but as others have said, it doesn't illuminate the hands very much, and definitely doesn't illuminate the LCD screens at all. The watch is pretty large, so if you have small wrists (I have average wrists) this watch may feel rather large., I wanted a good watch for a value price to wear playing golf and this is a beaut!, junk, 👍👍👍, Lots of compliments..., the vibrating alarm doesn't vibrate for a long period of time - the vibrations turns off after 2 vibrations., I got one of these beauties.  Looks nice, the outside is very high quality.  The rest is the opposite.  Cannot figure out how to hack the watch to synchronize the time, despite the user's manual.  The time is hard to tell, one has to search for the hour hand of the watch, because the three dials are mostly black or dark, same as most of the hour hand.  Worst of all the big red 60 second counter hand which jumps perhaps every second, does not line up with the 60 hash marks on the dial, but only about half the time.  Guessing, either the 60 second counter hand jumps at different intervals and they are not equal, or the hashmarks on the dial are not spaced equally. After nearly 162 years of watch making, a manufacturer should be able to divide the circle to 360 equal spaces and also should be able to make a second hand jump exactly 1/60th minute, every second. Operating the watch is NOT intuitive, the three time measuring dials are impossible to zero once.  The watch measures, stops, as if has its own mind, one may need a six month course to learn how to operate it. Question:  Why Tissot cannot fix the shortcomings of the watch, as I am sure they read the watch collector's blogs and many dozen people point out the same thing, I did above.  I have over two dozen watches and this will be the first one I get rid of, gladly., I got this on another website in Dec. 2014.  Very adorable watch. I loved it. Note, the past tense. I watched my hands and rinsed off dishes (no deep water immersion), ordinary daily routines. Somehow water got into the face, and it stopped.  So be very careful of not getting it wet, the water may leak in., Good but fogged up after a few months and could not read face., clock meets all expectations, Perfect timepiece for me and to top it all it came as a water resistant watch. The compass is not always acurate though but thats not nothing to complain about because the watch has real 24hour operation, The watch came in a timely manner and in an absolutely beautiful box. The watch itself has a gorgeous antique styled face, the winding action is precise and tight and the casing is a total conversation starter. This watch is easily worth twice the cost., It's ok, My 9 year old son loves it. It is a bit large on his hand but not too bad.  update: lowered to 2 stars.. 3 months have passed since we bought it. A couple of times when my son took it to the pool it got condensation which prevented seeing anything on the screen and this lasted not a few minutes but a day or so.   Now it just stopped working altogether., its okay kind of plain, I also ordered the Batman watch and instead received the Superman watch.  Do not order this item if you expect to get what you ordered., Very pretty watch with an easy to read big dial.  I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase., Terrible quality and cannot be programmed without the instructions and the instructions that came with it were in Chinese. Terrible purchase., I generally love Time Indigo but this one has been a disappointment. The Blue band started fading within a few weeks and I've lost time several times. I have not yet determined what caused that since it is not constant just occasional., We purchased this watch for our son (just turning 10). It is a great watch and he loves it. I only rated it as a 3 instead of a 5 because the band was rather long. The watch is identified as a Kids' watch however, the band is as long as my own Casio (AQS800W-1B2VCF). Also if you search the model number for the &#34;kids&#34; watch it will show up twice, labeled as a kids watch and as a men's watch.<br /><br />In short, I think it would be fine for a kid 10 years or older. A younger child may have too much of the band overhanging., Very pretty, elegant, I needed this to replace the far too small original brand on my LG G Watch.  Perfect length for me!, Nice watch, on time delivery from the seller., Love this watch it is my third Invicta from Amazon , however it worked for a week then would not keep time, I was on the road so had a new battery installed to see if that was the problem, No,  So I have shipped it of to Invicta with the $28 check  know we will see what happens .<br />My other two Invicta`s have been great. keeping good time., Very classy, a little spendy, but you get what you pay for. My son loves it., No complaints. It's incredibly light and it tells the time., super, super slim and chic. I gave it as a gift and it has been getting raves - from the recipient and non-stop from her friends., I haven't been impressed with this watch since I purchased it 4 months ago.  First, like others have mentioned, the metal band squeaked a lot when I first got it -- it was very annoying to constantly have a squeaking noise coming from my wrist when I moved.  I was able to silence the noise with a few shots of silicone lubricant.  Second, the watch does not keep time very accurately, even when I wear it every day, sometimes winding it if I have had it off for more than a few hours.  In my case, the watch gains a few minutes every few days.  Third, despite the beauty of the watch in the photo, in reality it is very hard to see the silver hands against the silver background -- just glancing at it to see the time isn't possible; you have to look at it for several seconds to distinguish where the hands are, and which hand is which; I hate wearing it in low light, and often I only choose it wear it (as opposed to my other watch) if I'm going to be outside where I can see the face better.  Finally, and most annoying, the crystal somehow became chipped under normal wearing conditions a couple of weeks ago, and now it has moisture in it.  In all my life of wearing watches, I've never had a crystal chip; and I know I didn't do anything outside of normal use.  So now, because the crystal isn't covered under warranty, it's going to cost $45 for repair.  I've had a lot of watches in the same price-point as this watch during my life, but never one of such poor quality.  I won't be buying a Relic watch again., That's what I want, I have had some version of this watch for 30 years. There is nothing better. The countdown  timer is a must for me. Thanks for keeping it available!, Exactly what I needed and wanted. Awesome and great price!, Band is impossible to shorten. Uses very tiny screws. I bought a 0.8 mm screwdriver and could listen it., Love the watch!  Beautiful, bright and clear display.  This is my work and snorkeling watch.<br /><br />This is not a con.  I knew what I was buying.  I wish that Armitron would also make sleeker LCD display watches with large numerals for more normal wear.<br /><br />If you want an all around good, and very legible LCD watch, I can only recommend it!<br /><br />Bernie, The picture of the watch on Amazon showed chrome plated hands on the watch.  The watch arrived with grey metal hands on the watch which make it somewhat difficult to read in low light conditions.  Otherwise it is great!!, Great Genuine Casio Watch!<br />-Japan made (Quality Wise)<br />-Easy to setup<br />-Classy look (Thanks to its retro design and gold tone)<br />-It's for MEN! (Thanks to its black frame color and band design)<br />-A must have model of Casio because it's very hard to find in any local store or atleast just in Australia.<br /><br />Delivered a little late than expected but did refund the shipping fee (Carrier issue, not the seller). But very satisfied with the watch. Thanks!, Sun permanantly turns it browninsh. Forget it., clock meets all expectations, I bought this watch from Amazon as the seller. So I will first review the Amazon experience, then the watch itself.<br /><br />It's quite difficult when it comes to rating Amazon, thing is the experience I've had with them over the years is incredibly positive. What I can  say is, the watch is authentic and I had it inspected by a Tissot shop. The packaging was great and the watch box had all the catalogues with it. When the seller is Amazon, buy with confidence.<br /><br />The watch itself is really a true piece of art. The blue dial and the outer black case with the white numbers all come together in perfect harmony with the stainless steel bracelet. It's subtle and a looker at the same time. It's not small whilst not too big either. For me it's about the perfect size. It's a bit heavy, but this only adds to the great feeling you get when you wear it. The thing I love most about this watch, is that with a quick glance, you get the time, day and date. I definitely recommend this watch., It seems to be a very cheap watch.  Accurate time keeping isn't possible.  Band fell apart after 3 weeks., I love this watch but within a month, the clasp has broken. Really disappointed!, OK so I have had this watch for a few days now and I can easily say is the best cheaply priced watch I have ever owned. It fits comfortably on the worst and it has some weight to it but not too much. Just enough. I have gotten multiple compliments on the sport amount of time I have had it., Nice. Loops are properly placed for extra strap length. Heavy weave., Good watch links scratch easily, The band is made out of some type of plastic and when it arrived weeks later the band was stained or had some type of water damage.. Got a full refund so happy at the end. ✌🏽😄, Disappointing!  After receiving the watch, reading the manual, and setting the city and Day Light Savings Time.  The auto setting for Day Light Savings time did not work.  The watch also was turned toward the west sun for 4 to 5 hours for two straight days, yet it never left M (medium power setting) designation for the solar battery.  It should have moved by the end of the first day to H for high battery power.  I returned the watch to Amazon, and received a full refunded of the purchase price., Very fast shipping.  The watch strap was like described. I have a small wrist and it fit perfect.  I am happy with purchase., The large size is QUITE large--had to return it for a medium, for my husband who is a pretty big guy., Very v cheaply made broke within the first 3 days, Handsome watch. However two caveats; one, the attractive band is way to large. I had to buy a smaller one that cost nearly as much as the watch! Two, the second hand has a loud ticking sound... can be very distracting at bight., I really like this watch.  The face is very big--really more the size for a man, which is perhaps why it's called &#34;unisex.&#34;  I can't imagine a man wearing it however; the  pink color and the glittery band make it quite feminine.  I would give this watch 5 stars except for 2 things: the day and date are difficult to advance correctly, and the plastic buckle is rather delicate--I envision it breaking at the point where the pin joins the buckle to the band., The SNZH53 is a very good automatic watch at its price point. It keeps good time, has a decent power reserve and the deep blue of the face and bezel is very pretty. The crystal is fairly scratch resistant. Not as good as high end watches, but the hardlex will prevent all but the hardest bangs from leaving a mark. The worst thing about this watch is the bracelet. It feels light and cheap. If you're planning to wear it on an aftermarket strap, as I do, that's not an issue. Though it's a &#34;divers watch&#34; it doesn't have a screw-down crown so it's not really great for doing a lot of underwater wear. That said, I've gone swimming with it on and had no ill effects., This watch is very attractive, and I very happy to wear it., Products like these which need time to show what they are and how good or bad they may be, need TIME. We have not even given it as the gift we bought it fopr, and may be later they would be owner will advise how is was.<br />Please give these items time to prove or disapprove themselves., I ordered this watch online and I absolutely love it. It's true to the picture, very sophisticated. It's great for nights out. Overall an amazing purchase!, Classy!!, Pelage dial with tiny jewels positioned at 10,25,40,and 50 minutes. There is a date function its a perfect size and it is comfortable. Oh, yeah, its also gorgeous., Very sturdy and light., Too large by far! Cannot be adjusted., Very nice watch , very high quality and 80 hours power reserv is excellent future , love it. Due its size , which is on medium-small size, for perfect balans I recommend this watch for smaller and skinny types of wrists,, Black strap is stylish.  The holes are well sealed so they should not fray but I don't think you could add your own holes. The buckle is metal but slightly lighter than I expected - still it should be strong enough.  Although the band is 9.5 inches (24 cm) not counting the buckle there are no holes for the first inch so it only just fits my 8.5 inch (21.5 cm) wrist., Awesome watch arrived quickly, I wanted an outrageously styled and colorful watch. Boy did I find it., Love the watch, back light is bad but you learn to deal with it. Looks great. Directions came in Japanese so I went onto UTUBE and watch a video. Very durable I'm in law enforcement and have slammed it a couple of times dealing with bad guys and not a scratch on it.giving it 4 stars because of the back light., The watch appears nice and is a copy of what we saw on your site being advertised. But it is for a gift; and then again it takes time for the owner to use it and get back to us after  a while as to if it was a good watch and worked out well, or it was junk. Please give these item time for evaluation., This replacement band is not as comfortable as the original that came with the watch. The finish also is somewhat disappointing with excess flash around the openings where pins go. Would not purchase again., The watch indicates it is &#34;Indiglo Night Light&#34; but pressing the A button or the Crown does not turn it on.<br />How does it turn on?<br />Both the hour hand and the minute hand are very narrow and it is difficult to see in low light., All titanium, eta 2824 movt, 2 butter soft silicone straps, watch winder- at less than $200. I'm not kidding., Sucks, All was as expected! Thank you., Do not purchase the watch!  I tried numerous times to get this watch to function and could not.  I then realized there was no resource for support.  I have returned the watch and I recommend you not invest the time and money that I have., I suggest you do not waste your money on this ,bracelet was broken in less than a month  i use., Always getting complimented, AWESOME, I just rec'd my Bessky watch and it's nicer than the $50 Timex digital I replaced. It has a very large face and is very easy to read. It looks like I paid $50 + for it. I was hoping it would be this nice but really didn't expect it.  For $5.68 with free shipping I will replace this as required without a care for the cost. I set the time/date etc. and tried the stop watch without referring to the directions that came with it. Very intuitive to set up. Stop watch with lap time very easy to useTHIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE IN MORE THAN A YEAR.<br />TONY B., It's a very nice watch band. Good leather and is well made.  This should last a long time., As a former Rolex owner (GMT Master) for 35 years, I have been very surprised by this Stuhrling watch.  Yes, its' a quartz watch, not a chronograph, the band isn't as heavy duty, as the Rolex was, but still this 824.01 is very attractive and is working well.  Compared to a $3k watch with a $250 band, this is a good alternative.  Very pleased with it., This is funny story. The package it came in smelled like leather and the watch says Polo and looks so Expensive. I had to go recheck to make sure i paid $9.99 and not $99.99. I thought i might have made a mistake. I didnt. In fact there was not saying it is not affiliated with Raulph Lauren. Ive gotten compliments on this watch. To me its worth $100. I love it! You will too if you like gaudy. Once i thought i broke it because it fell on floor and a piece came off, but it was a piece for in case you want to adjust it and make it bigger or smaller., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one., I will start from the shipping, I got the watch a day after Amazon scheduled the delivery day. Still it was kind of fast 5days. The package where the watch came it was an envelope And a zip lock bag with no instructions. but still no damaged to the watch! Now the watch, is a beautiful and awesome watch the materials are the same used by the big brands! The day after the delivery I used the watch and got compliments from many people! One guy even said to me &#34; hey awesome hublot wish I could afford one&#34; lol. When I got home I Checked hublot website and they look exactly the same as this watch the only difference is the price hublot 34k and this watch 34dlls!!! If you thinking about buying this watch please don't just buy it I highly recommend this watch is really really nice and for the price is just an awesome deal I just bought two more! If I could I will give more than 5 stars! Happy shopping!, Really pretty and cool watch.  My 10 years old love it.  Has multiple functions as chronograph, alarm (you can set 3 different alarms), light and it is water resistant ... it's a bit tricky to remember the order to press the buttons to program it.  Loved the color., This item needs a LED light to indicate when the item is on.  No visual to tell when on or off., Watching arrive on time and it is nice as I was expecting, Just the right strap and they included a second strap for free!, The watch band fit nicely with my watch. It doesn't come with the two metal pieces/rods that attach the band to the watch. But you can use your old ones. You'll need a very small screw driver or small pocket knife to remove and replace the two metal rods. They are spring loaded so they compress.The thing about the band that kept me from rating it higher is the color. I expected it to be darker than it appeared on the web site. But it is still OK and very functional., Was perfect for putting the backs onto watches after changing the batteries.  Very easy to use.  Already used it on 3 watches., First, the pros: This is a nice-looking, automatic movement watch for much cheaper that you can usually find. It's styled after the Rolex Submariner, and it can be worn causually or dressed up. The blue dial and bezel are the perfect shade - bright and colorful without being garish.<br /><br />But, it can't tell time. I've set it repeatedly, wearing it to ensure it was getting wound, and it's consistently fast, sometimes by as much as several minutes after a single day. You had ONE job, watch!<br /><br />I have trouble even calling it a watch because it's useless for telling time. I shouldn't have trusted a company who has a watch (distinct from this one) in their &#34;Pro Diver&#34; collection that can't even be taken in the shower!, I can recommend this watch. High quality and it has performed as advertised. A couple of things that might not be right for some. One it is a heavy watch. Two it sits on your wrist higher than other watches. Also because of the metal band you may needed to remove some links, as I did. If you have a thick wrist, the band does not come with extra links, should it fit you too tight. Again rated 5 stars for my use., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, The previous version was streamlined and had a flow from maid body through band. This version has a bit larger body and band is not as heavy and feels a bit cheaper.<br /><br />Technical functionally is great., Loved it. Came really quickly. Very functional. Little tricky to set up date., I love my watch it's exactly as pictured. A boyfriend style watch with the copper/rose gold accents., This clock is pretty. Recommended., Just awesome! Ive been after this watch for about 3 yrs and i couldnt find it. When i saw it on Amazon again, i just had to have it. I also own the mod 9937 and ive been very happy with it. They both have a swiss movement, that is why its more expensive than japanese movement counterparts., Have a timex expedition watch.  Liked it and the band it came with.  After a year of heavy duty wear the band got caught and ripped loose from the watch.  I thought I would have to buy a new watch.  Ordered this band which looked similar first and I'm glad I did.  It's better than the original in comfort and works the same.  Even if it only lasts a year I am still money ahead., Awesome!., I love it. Lightweight and comfortable, it fits with any occasion and overall a great everyday watch to have., I love the watch!!! However I only received the white one. Who can I talk to about not getting the black one delivered, It came rusted. Do not buy this watch!, Amazing..., The blue faced diamond accented Armitron watch is very pretty!, As a watch person, I really love this particular model. I didn't want to take my Tag watch to school, so I bought this as an alternative since it really resembles the Rolex Submariner. I've got many compliments from people, most of them assuming it was an actual Rolex. So if your looking for a nice watch that isn't too heavy, stylish, and won't break the bank, than this is it. I already plan to purchase another one in a different color., Very nice for a solar watch, i've had plenty of watchs that were a bit better but i would buy this again worth every penny, Strap is great quality but the design is flawed. The loops for turning the strap back on itself are too near the buckle, meaning the tail of the strap sticks out a lot. I have a luminox branded nato strap on another watch which is much neater and more comfortable., Bought 2 (4 months apart) and neither is water resistant.  The description says water-resistant to 165 feet; the pool is 10 feet deep.  After the kids wore it the pool several times, the inside fogged up and the buttons became difficult to press and sometimes unresponsive.  Timex will replace it - if you ship it to them ($) and include $8 for return shipping and they recommend insuring it in case of loss during transit...  for a $15 watch.  Shame... my kids really liked the watches too., As expected!, When I first saw the watch, I was so happy not until I discovered that the watch is not working, I was so disappointed, and the seller is something else, they said I have to send the watch back with my own money when the fault is theirs, it's very very unfair,, Nice quality ,comfortable to wear . The hands  are however small and with the dark grey background  it is somewhat difficult to quickly glance to see the time., Excelente!, Fit the watch with out problems. Nice color. Good price.  But the leather was thick enough that it rubs against the watch side causing the leather to have small tear where it rubs., I have only had this watch for a week but it keeps to-the-second exact time, at least in reference to my cell phone's time.  The compass is reasonably accurate, but I still need to calibrate it, so assume it will perform even better afterward.  All in all I am very happy with this watch so far., very sheik, This watch is AWESOME! Very well made and after many years of use is still as good as when I bought it. Many compliments on the orange face too., There jewel missing from the interface may be form shiping, To heavy., The rectangular shape is very nice.I have received  several compliments on the watch.It is hardier to read in lower light because of the darker face and lighter numerals.You don't also want to push the light button to check the time., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, I have it over a month now seems awsome no sound great quality would recommend it. The gift gloves are too small in size should be a medium size, Band broke in two days the pieces are cheap., Piece of junk, Nice quality! Very durable. It is very stiff though and takes time to break in., Really gorgeous watch!, I bought the watch knowing that it was not the best quality....Looks good but is not overly self-winding.  I have to wind it everyday so I guess the self-winding is just to maintain through that day. 3-30-16 UPDATE: Link pins are now coming out.  This is my dress/work watch so no I'm not scaling mountains with it on.  I have had better success with my &#34;drugstore&#34; watch that cost 10 bucks!   Down to 1 star.  Not worth the money at all.....would make a great paper weight though!, Different, Sweet, Feminine!  A little hard to see the time due to the &#34;busy&#34; pattern but I buy a watch more for the Jewelry effect and color coordination!!, WORST ITEM IVE EVER PURCHASED!!!! All of the watches broke the first time I put them on, I should have expected that for the price. But in this case I definitely did not get what I paid for, I GOT WAAAAY LESS !!!!!! NO STARS AT ALL, Terrific!, I bought this as a present, and have been told that very acceptable and exactly what was wanted. It's very bright too, Very bad<br />Eager leakage and it is not water resistant, This watch has it all.  The basic features you expect (timer, stopwatch, multiple alarms, etc.), plus atomic sync, solar powered, and a nice backlight.  On top of that, it looks great and is very comfortable.  The size is a little bit big for my taste, but is still reasonable for my 5'9&#34; 170lbs body.  I really wanted to like this watch, but there is one major issue that caused me to return it.  The display is just too small, especially for such a big watch.  My main digital watch for the past 10 years has been the standard issue Timex Ironman 30-lap, and the display on this Casio is about half that size.  I'm a middle age guy with good eyesight, but I want my watch to be easy to read, and this Casio just falls short on that.  In the end, if you can tolerate the small display, this is a brilliant watch., Beatyfull, Update on 8/4/16 - the watch stopped working (battery) on 8/3/2016 which is less than a year after purchase (8/19/15).<br /><br />I bought this based on another product experience - [[ASIN:B005DRE6UU Invicta Men's 1431 Sea Hunter Black Dial Rubber Watch]] it has issues when wearing for extended period of time.<br /><br />Issues: Strap breaks, second hand stops and the two brackets to keep the strap in place break off. Also because the watch has a second hand +date the time will eventually slow down, so the correct time will not be kept. This is a design fault.<br /><br />The silver 1431 watch looks better on your wrist than the 1432.<br /><br />Still... it's okay for everyday wear., Watch Face smaller than expected but dope watch. I love it. And I don't know what these other 'reviewers' are talking about because the band is very comfortable., It is so big,the watch is not suitable for me., excelente, Awesome watch for an awesome price at the time. I got this for my son's grad gift. He loves it. Shipping was prompt., Got wrong watch, I bought this red watch for my daughter's birthday. I opened the box and it is PINK! Not her favorite. I'm not sure where the problem truly lies. The only problem is the color., Still trying to figure out all of the settings., It’s a good watch band. I changed the original band on my diver watch and it complements it well. The materials are nice, both, the metal pieces and the nylon., Not an OEM band. Yes, this band says Seiko and is sturdy, but is sturdy to the point where I have found it uncomfortable for constant wearing. The band is not near as soft and pliable as the one which came with my original Black Monster watch. It looks vey similar, but again is not the original., It's cute. It's fairly lightweight. Makes a charming keychain. The watch, which is what it was bought for is not as charming. The hinge is awkward and hard for my mother's hands to operate. We've had it only a few months and already it is no longer keeping time. Could be the battery but that seems doubtful., Nice watch. I returned it as it was small on my wrist., Didn't realize this came from China. There's a reason it was so cheap - it's kind of crappy. Watch face came cracked., My husband LOVE it, I will definitely buy more in the future different color of course., I like this Timex Expedition watch a lot. The Indiglo feature means that I can now read my watch in the dark. My old Timex not only kept the exact time for more than 10 years but was still waterproof till the end., Face is too small. Need glasses to read time. Item returned., The time on the watch goes faster than normal time so I have to keep changing it and it's hard to see anything on it during the day (practically impossible when you're running.), Very Happy!  This is my second purchase and its great for a gift, I like this watch so far.  I've been a fan of Seiko watches but last year decided to  try Fossil as highly recommended by a Macy's staff due to frequent hand washing for nurses.  I was hoping not to have the replace the battery every year as needed by my previous Seiko watch and have to deal with the poor watch sealing after battery replacements. I was wrong.  The battery in my Fossil watch died within a year.  I took it back to Macy but they refused to fix it because I've misplaced my receipt and Macy could not find the  online receipt either. I ended up taking it to a jewel store for battery replacement.  It worked for approx a week after the battery replacement but died again, probably due to the poor sealing of the watch by the jeweler.  I did not want to spend the extra money to send it back to Fossil for repair either.  I did some checking and decided to try this Seiko solar watch since the solar Seiko watch i've bought for my husband several years ago still work. So far it has been working great.  The face and numbers are large enough to read and the red second-hand allows me to count heart and respiration rates incrementally well.  I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because the date and the day of the week displayed on the watch do not always match and will take some time to get them to display right. I am happy with my new Seiko solar watch., Sent as a gift.  No instructions though, on how to set the date/time.  Figured out the time on our own, but not the date., This is a quality tool kit that will pay for itself many times over again through usage.  It has everything you would want for the DYI man.  My husband has a collection of watches and is a craftsman in another trade so he is picky about his tools.  He was delighted with this purchase.  The price is deceptively low.  I truly was not expecting the quality that I got., Nice and classy appeal. Solid construction., Arrived earlier than we thought. My son is happy to have it. Easy to wear and to adjust the time. Fits well in his little arms. Overall happy with the product., broke as soon as i got it, I'm always a little skeptical when there's a big difference in price between products, after all, you get what you pay for.  In this case, this watch band is more than worth the price paid. I replaced a Citizen watch band, and this band is just as comfortable and a little more stylish than the original.  I highly recommend this product., Dead battery.  Sent it back for another of same model and the next watch came. Guess what. ANOTHER DEAD BATTERY., Really fun looking and iconic alarm clock at a reasonable price for a Star Wars fanatic!  Clock works just fine as does the alarm., Easy to install and exact replacement, The watch was massive. I took it to a jeweler and had three links taken out. It was okay for two weeks, and then broke. I think the screws were just poor quality., The strap is a bit more maroon than red, but a great color overall. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., I am extremely pleased with the product., My eyesight isn't great, especially in dim light. I really like everything about it. The large black face with white numbers and hands makes it so easy to read. The Indiglo light makes it perfect for me. The style, with an adjustable leather band, contrasting white stitching and silver color casing, is very appealing. It was more than $10.00 below retail. At $36.99 you can't beat the value. To me, Timex has always been one of the most reliable and durable brand on the market. I don't need an expensive watch for a status symbol. I just want an attractive watch that tells me the time accurately and is dependable. Timex still makes a great watch at an excellent price., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one. But this one again, is awesome!, The quality is wonderful and it's stylish., Simple but cool., This is my 3rd versioon, It is cheap and I didn't expect a lot. But my question is: is it a male watch? The bracelet is a little too short for my hand and my arm. Half centimeter longer should be enough to fit comfortable, I ordered this watch on ebay but it had to go back due to a defective date wheel. The unscrupulous seller tried to say I didn't align the 24-hour dial with the main display but I did. Despite the inconvenience I learned that I really loved how this watch looks and wanted to replace it ASAP!<br /><br />Anyhow, over a month in to the one I ordered on sale from amazon and I couldn't be happier. It keeps excellent time, losing only one-minute every 4-5 days. The date wheel works as it should, and the compliments keep pouring in.<br /><br />I can't afford a $26K Hublot with industrial rise gold appointments, but this sub-$200 Diesel has to be one of the best values around. I love its sculpted dials and the large display is easy to read, along with luminescent accents when the lights go out. The leather band is glove soft and I do believe that this will last me many years. I like the chronograph option too and am getting used to using it for various applications.<br /><br />All-in-all, a killer watch! Highly recommended!!!, Not please with  it, JUST AS DESCRIBED, Very light., not fair to ding the watch as other reviewer did because it is too big for him...it is lightweight and a super watch., For a very inexpensive watch I was pleasantly surprised! Construction was solid.  Band feels cheap and lightweight and appears to be like aluminum but so far holds up well. It is an automatic but also has a mechanical winder as well.  For $15 dollars you can't go wrong., Nice watch! The color of the band and body aren't common so that's pretty cool! The watch itself is pretty heavy so it seems like pretty good quality.  I got it on sale for less than 80 bucks so that was a great deal!, excelente, Fine watch,, but can not hear alarm..., After few month paint started peeling off!, I have bought 8 of these as a gift. Their Solar. You can swim with them. Light and double hour. Get it!, We bought this watch for our daughter and she loves it. She's only 3 and can't actually tell time yet but she wears it all the time. Its nice that its waterproof and the band makes it easy for her to take on and off.And she was excited to the cool 3D texture. Good purchase., I have never found a watch I like more than this one in terms of features and functionality, but over the years, the quality has seen a sharp decline.  I have found the need to replace it at least once a year, not because of the watch, but because the band inevitably breaks.  After reading several reviews with the same complaint, I contacted Timex customer service: custserv@timex.com.<br /><br />Timex replied the same day and offered to fix or replace the watch for $10.  They sent instructions along with a pre-paid mailing label so I could send the watch and check.  By the next week, I had a new watch.<br /><br />The inconvenience is a pain, but I was impressed with their customer service and am happy to have my tried and true watch back without having to purchase a brand new one., Doesn't fit a large wrist. Tells great time, easy to read., Zodiac is now one of the best brands I own. Apart from the watch being beautiful, well built and easy to read during bright light and at night; it's extremely comfortable to wear!! This is now my second Zodiac, I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, the package was open and the battery was dead! very poor way to sell a product., It is good and lot of cheaper thank officer website, the watch has met all my expectations, and is now my everyday wear!, I thought it said made of wood in the description but it wasn't. One corner was not glues together. I had to return it., Face plate broke on my fiance after 2 days.  Horrible choice, Well built, everything you'd expect from a Swiss Army., gets broken easily, Cool kids watch with unique layout for telling time., Junk! Went swimming in pool & watch filled up with water almost instantly. This happened on the last day (30 days) of warranty so no refund. :(, The watch is lovely but beware the bracelet.  It is very difficult to adjust unless you're a jeweler.  My husband (who is very handy) tried to remove some links and the strap broke very easily.  Pay to have a jeweler adjust the fit., WAY too BIG and awkward (size not obvious in the pictures)., I purchased this Casio watch a week ago to replace a much more expensive watch that kept giving me problems, first with water leakage, then with a faulty band.  It's a nice-looking watch with high-visibility numbers and hands.  Setting the time was easy, and it's keeping accurate time.  The band seems rugged.  I haven't done anything abusive to it yet, so I don't know how the crystal will hold up (the super-hard crystal was one thing I loved about my troublesome old watch).  The Casio does not have a screw-down crown to keep out moisture, but I've been wearing it in the shower with no signs of moisture problems yet.  So, all-in-all, I'm quite pleased with the watch, especially for the price.  I didn't give it five stars because, really, how much can you love a cheap watch like this?  But in terms of value for the money, it's definitely looking like five stars so far., The watch starting losing time almost immediately., The strap of the watch was cut after using the watch for only 2 days<br />Don't buy this watch, I can't really personally give a review here because it was a gift for my boyfriend. He's a watch collector though with some pretty expensive taste (his next &#34;reasonably priced&#34; watch that he wants is over $3,000). He loves this watch and wears it at least once a week., This watch will not allow for second hand setting.  Two other watches were sent and they too could not set second hand.  Just be aware that these Seiko watches are not made in Japan!, This watch is awesome, it's a high quality design. The product arrived 2 weeks earlier than estimated., Very cute and durable, clock meets all expectations, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Beautiful watch and bracelet.  Not a bad color so it doesn't scream fake but the clamp is very hard to open so it's not that easy to put on., The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., I bought this watch for my girlfriend, she was so happy when I gave it to her, very nice I really recommend, Disappointed!  Boring due to same color on the band, the trim and he face!!, This watchband literally fell apart after 6 weeks of wear.  The leather at the connection to the watch started to pull apart, but before that part broke, the leather at the buckle gave way and the buckle fell off.  Since there was no way to repair it, it went in the trash., it's pretty early to  to give a good rating, but I think I'm going to love it, The blue is very dark, almost a black.  Not as light as the picture shows., This was a great buy and a beautiful watch, but I returned it because the face was really large, the band was very loose, and it's too &#34;flashy&#34; for wearing it with my normal wardrobe. I think if you were dressed up for a special occasion, it might be just right. It's hard to rate it with the stars, so I put three., Have had this watch for one week and am very pleased with it so far.  It is my first automatic watch and is more accurate than I expected.. I have been recording times with an app called WatchCheck, from Google Play Store, and over the last week it is only running fast by just over 6 seconds (an average of 0.9 sec/day per the app).  It runs slightly fast when wearing and slightly slow when off and laid vertical with 3:00 up.  They seem to cancel out very well.<br />It is very light thanks to the titanium construction.<br />I cannot comment on the water resistance of the watch since I have not exposed it to water, It does have a screw in crown that seems sturdy.<br />Some things I suggest for future models:<br />a) a larger luminous area on the second hand.  Hard to see in dim light.<br />b) better luminosity in general.  They are bright when you first go into a dark room but seem to fade fairly quickly, Basically, don't expect to wake up in the middle of the night and easily see the hands of the watch when it's on your nightstand.  There is some glow, but it is very faint, making it fairly hard for me to tell the time even when fully dark adapted. Maybe add red outlines on all the hands since the minute hand is much easier to see.<br />c) a domed crystal: this watch has a flat crystal and it does seem more reflective (see photo).  Have also read that domed are more durable, but I have not had any problems with durability of this one to date.<br />d) more watch band options:  I got the bund band and it seems it be of good quality and was comfortable but I also ordered a nato/zulu style band from Infantry Co., that I think looks sportier (see photo) and makes it less likely to drop the watch if a lug spring pin popped for any reason.  I will probably mainly use the nylon band.<br />Overall I think the watch is a good value (the other watches I had considered were Hamilton's that were considerably more expensive and did not have the screw in crown and therefore, were rated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.ated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it., (*Full Disclosure* I purchased this watch elsewhere on a TV network so this is a C&P of my review for it)<br />For a long time I was teetering back and forth from choosing this or the SAN Specialty mirror high polish gold/gold, but in the end it came down to me preferring the face of the SAN IV which imo needs no explanation, the line has many beautiful combinations all of which being due to the great cutout layering of the Swiss cross throughout the dial. Getting on to reviewing the watch, a piece that hopefully will once again be in stock and available for sale again lest my review be in vain.<br /><br />It arrived and of course it was immediately sized, and resized and micro adjusted a few times, yes this is a watch and bracelet design that can be challenging to those not familiar with large heavy watches with SS bracelets, it's all about finding that sweet spot and then it's smooth sailing. I emphasize this because proper sizing and simple micro-adjusts can make or break your watch experience. Depending on the weather or season my wrist can vary quite a bit, so I size it as tight as possible with the links and then I'm able to easily adjust the band in small increments.<br /><br />Next up is the finish, wow what a finish it is! If you have a little OCD as I do you may want to keep a soft polishing cloth in your back pocket,lol but I am serious, it gets smudged very easily. About the extra &#34;clear coat&#34; as I like to call it, it acts much like the nickname I gave it. When I closed the safety clasp it was very tight and after 30+ uses I was pretty amazed to see that the finish was still holding firm, not even a scratch. Normally a watch that has a matte finish or SS will likely leave a good scratch on the clasp where the safety clamps down, not the case here. I've worn it A LOT over the first month and did several of my own rigorous quality control experiments which is, if you don't know, extremely important when dealing with Invicta. While my haphazardnesshas etched plenty of very fine hairline scratches, none of them even came close to the depth of the actual gold finish thanks to the clear coat polish.<br /><br />Finally, after all of that 30 day break in, the movement and chronograph have been 100% functional and the time is within one second from which I set it to on arrival, month date and snapback day of the week all working just fine. The Ronda 8040N is easily my favorite quartz movement. As for the flash of the finish, yea it's loud and blingy, not everyone can pull it off, but you guys can sort that kinda thing out for yourselves. As for me I love it. This marks my 7th higher end Invicta I've purchased in the last year and a half, all of them Swiss quartz and over that time every single watch is within 5 seconds of what I set it too. The bottom line is that Invicta's design team has been operating at a level of intricacy and making designs that are unrivaled in their beauty and function(when they do function;)har har, and this piece is proof of it. I really wish they would attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye by boosting QC and CS, but until then they will leave customers weary, even people like me who have had nothing but positive experiences and collectors alike can't help but to hope to heck they don't ever need to deal with Invicta's CS for warranty service, but enough of that, they know what needs improvement and as long as I continue to receive quality timepieces I'll remain I customer of Invicta. Pictures included below. JD, PURCHASED FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES THIS WATCH! SHE WEARS IT ALL THE TIME!, Little on the large side for a women's watch. Keeping good time so far 4 rating due to size, Gorgeous watch at a reasonable price. Very classy, elegant, and simple. The casing it comes in is also very nice!, Worst item ever purchased, not even worth a DIME!!! Broke the first time I wore it, fell right off my arm while I was wearing it,, Beautiful watch.  I own several Kenneth Cole watches in different styles, and this is one of my favorites.  The dial is easy to read and while I typically wear reading glasses,  I am able to read the day/date hands without them.  Besides a wedding band, watches are the only &#34;jewelry&#34; that I wear.  This one fills the bill as both an attractive and functional timepiece. The only negative comment I would share, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 relates to the description which indicates that this watch has a &#34;21-jewel, Japanese quartz analog automatic movement, with exhibition case back&#34;.  It is a Japanese quartz movement but does not have an exhibition case back, nor an automatic (self-winding) movement., Just as described....works wonderful...fast delivery as well ., I waited for a long time after placing the order, but in the end it all worth the wait.<br /><br />Very decent quality and packaging, especially considering the reasonable price., This is a fantastically well-made, quality product.  Easily the best watch band I've ever owned!  Except for the fact that when I sweat the band stains my arm . I guess whatever they use to stain the leather didn't set properly or something.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it five stars.  The black finish had started wearing off the hardware,  but that just gives it charm I think.<br /><br />Update: I bought this watchband on August 16, 2015. I used it for one year and seven months before replacing it. I've changed this review from 3 to 4 stars based on the durability of the band over that time. The hardware held up without fault, aside from the loss of color. Towards the end the leather started showing it's age by cracking and stretching. This is forgivable since this band only cost a surprising $11 at the time. Arm staining continued for a few months before tapering off with no lasting effects. Overall, this was a really great value and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others.<br /><br />(Last three pictures are after 1yr 7mths of use), it broke, I want my money back., I feel that I'm going to ask for a replacement because the glass you can see has some very little bruises which is unnoticeable and the product is very chique and classy., I have gone through a variety of Casio watches, and by far this is the best one I have ever acquired: Very sturdy, large font to see the time, the buttons on the sides require significant force to apply hence do not get pressed by mistake. The solar charge works very well; you can get it fully charged by placing it out in the bright sun one day (all day), after which just make sure to give it some sun on a regular basis (while wearing)., Just what I wanted!, I've been wearing this watch for several months and I love it. It's a great weight and isn't too heavy. The face is striking and easily readable, with the mother of pearl adding a nice touch. I've worn it underwater many times while swimming this summer with no moisture leaking in. The bubble over the date took a bit to get used to, but now I can read the date without issues. Easily adjusted to the correct size for me. The clasp feels secure and I haven't noticed it opening at all. I have noticed a bit of the rose gold finish wearing off where my wrist rests on tabletops, but it's not noticeable to anyone but me. Great watch, would buy again!, Nice watch, however the buckle on the watch band broke when I first tried it on!!, Perfectly adequate traditional watch and band with date and handy Indiglo (face lights up with pressing on the knob) feature.<br />Cost is about 2/3 of buying in Target or other retail facility. arrived promptly as promised., It has already fallen apart!, Watch itself it neat, but the rods that hold the band on keep popping off., The colors, ease of use, and style of this watch are great. The size should be good for most people. I am a woman with slim/average sized wrists and wear the watch almost at its tightest. The watch is lightweight and fairly slim.<br />Negatives: The inner Velcro seam was itchy at first, but it doesn't bother me as much after a couple days. Also, the date isn't displayed on the face unless you press start/stop., The backlight is not very good. It only lights up the digital section at the bottom of the watch. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with this watch., very think strap, Simple and elegant design for the tightest of budgets. It's plastic so the cover will scuff easily, but a replacement is cheap!, This is a good watch for people who want something simple -- no alarms, no extra gadgets.  I've only had it a few months, though, so can't say how it will last., Its a bad ass watch., VERYYYYY GOOOOOD, A little small, Took about a month to get here, but it's worth the wait. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it even glows in the dark :), Excellent watch! Does all I need it to do. Use the stopwatch often. Also temperature function. All easy to access and fairly easy to operate. Complicated! Just what I wanted for years., It's very nice and exactly what I expected. I already had a silver one., I absolutely love this watch!! Thankfully there was no physical damage to the watch but it was loose in the box like it had just been put in there with limited care. I was a little disappointed when opening the box but thankfully the watch still had its plastic covering on the face to help protect it.  Overall, I was very pleased with the purchase. It even came in the Fossil tin. :), Broke in two weeks, I never have to worry about the time again since its an atomic talking watch. Nice big numbers and it even lights up at night! I'll never want to go back to a regular watch again!, The lid of the box doesn't close properly with my Seiko SSC007 in it., Love this watch, very simple and straight forward. nothing to distract you when trying to read time., Not bad, not great. It takes a little getting accustomed to, though I am not a techie wizard. The only thing I would change is the digital display. It is dim until the light is turned on. It reads the temperature accurately and other functions seem to work well. It needs to have time to take it through my routine., very nice watch as I am an ESQ fan having owned a number of ESQ watches in the past... my favorite ESQ's  though have been and still are their Octane line of watches that they have since discontinued.. the Octane snap clasp rubber watchband is better for my needs than this standard band... this is overall a super nice watch though.. nice large numerals that are easily readable..great crystal quality..  still very happy overall with ESQ-Movado watches .. BTW I just purchased a 2nd one thru Amazon today 2/9/2016, have to say originally,  I could not tell the difference between the band that came on my citizen watch and this one. They have the same look, same thickness. This one was advertised as Leather, and while the back portion seems to be leather, the front (the part that everyone sees) is DEFINITELY NOT LEATHER...BUT VERY CHEAP VINYL. It has cracked and split to the point that after less than six weeks, I have to get another watch band. I have included a picture that shows how the band wore out over this time period and proves that it cannot be leather., Needed a battery operated, reliable alarm clock.  This one is easy to read, the alarm is loud enough to wake me, but not jarring or harsh. There's an easy-to-locate button to light the face if you need to take a look during the night., Its stylish as well as functiones great with quiet mechanism unlike my old Timex. I just wish it had a sweeping second hand option without having to keep the stopwatch feature turned on., It just wonderful. Best if you want to give as a gift., I got this watch because I always see  it posted online with rave reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't like the band initially, but it has come to grow on me. The watch comes with a ton of functions, I don't think I'll use them all except for the indiglo feature. On thing I was happy about was that this watch doesn't have the loud tick that so many Timex watches suffer from. I was able to snag this on sale, but I wouldn't mind paying full retail for this watch. If you are looking for a stylish daily driver, do yourself a favor and get this watch., fell off apart and i am trying to send it back to company., 10 points. everything was as expected, exactly products, Band fell off after wear it a while, Thought this watch too big for even me, a large watch lover. I think had the watch itself been somewhat thinner  and the band slightly more narrow I would have kept it as it was a beautiful color. As it was, I returned mine the same day I received it. But for those who love really large face watches, this one is great!, The pictures don't really give you an impression of how big it is. THIS THING IS GIANORMOUS!!! Perfect if you want everyone to know that you are wearing a watch. But not really my style., That best buy ever, The product as per the shipping agreement. The watch was packaged well. The only problem was the battery was just about dead. I had to send the watch to Nixon to have the battery replaced., you get what you pay for.  not the best quality.  would not buy again., this watch performs all the functions I need it to have it perform. It is inexpensive and durable. I'll buy another one when this one breaks., Not sure if it's even genuine. This watch can pass 12 two or three times before the date will change., Love this watch. Face is easy to read and not too big on my wrist. Leather band is beautiful shade of blue and comfortable as well. Thanks for a great value., I've just received this watch 4 days ago and when I press the light buttom it goes like crazy, changing light colors and it doesn't stop.<br />I set the time and just one day after it had 45 minutes behind real time.  So, It definitely has a serious quality problem!<br />So, It's just a waste of money!, This is a cool looking watch without going too far, the stainless steel case is well machined and solid, the offset 10 O'Clock crown is knurled making it easy to grip while adjusting. A Sapphire Crystal is strong preventing scratches much better than mineral glass that you'l find in many watches in this price range.  This watch comes in a shaped ballistic nylon case that zips the clam shell case closed keeping your watch safe when not being worn. The second hand extends the full 12 to 6 O'clock length, half of the second hand is red so its easy to keep track of. The ribbed soft rubber strap is light and comfortable, its shaped at the contact points helping to keep it from rolling around on your wrist. No rubber smell emitting from this strap. The hour and minuet hands have blue/Green luminous markers, they hold a good glow for longer than most showing Oakley cared about the details., I used a push pin to remove links from the band, which was very easy. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., i have just received my hilfiger men's watch. it is perfect except that i cannot get instruction anywhere`order no. 701-2002682=7454662  it is a<br />tommy hilfiger men's 1710337.  please. i know that i am no quite in the rightn dept., It's a good watch for the price. The watch band broke already, just popped apart., very very nice finish , fast and easy to adjust !, I got it in a black plastic bag covered in tape. It doesn't tell the time. Its about a half second slow. It confused me for half the day. Also the strap broke as I first put it on. The gem stones instide the watch fell off on that one day I wore it. I guess it makes a good maraca..., Scrached to easy and if i would have known it was so heavy i would not have bought it., What a gorgeous watch!  I am a nurse and wanted an everyday watch to wear to work with some style.  This is it!  I have received many compliments already!, Exactly as advertised. It's the real deal. My pathfinder has seen some rough days, and the band was about to go. I expected to have problems with the screws, but aside from having to use knives as screwdrivers, the bolts came out and went back in easily, even though they were badly bent. That's the only downside to this product; it doesn't come with the screws, but it said that in the description. But the band is nice and legit. Nicer than my ratty old watch!, Is so cute .love it, Just what was shown and ordered.  Delivery etc was good., Strap too short and I don't have large wrists.  Loops keep migrating.  Other than that it does it's job albeit &#34;snugly&#34;.  For 12 bucks I'm being too fussy., Magnifique watch very sturdy very high quality 100% recommend use it everyday, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Fits the wrist very well and it's a cool watch.  Does not come with any instructions and it's pretty tough to set., Excellent replacement/alternate  watch, considering it's not a &#34;high dollar&#34; model.  I bought it as a back up to my other watch of the same type, and I was surprised to see it has a 10 year battery (didn't think that was possible; will see).  Anyway, the five alarms are nice to have, it looks nice; with decent sized numbers for me (eyesight's not what it used to be).  Nice color.  My other is black and silver this is as pictured, black and blue; which is cool, as I like both colors.  Nifty little inexpensive watch to have.  It includes manual, which the Casio Men's AW80D-1AVCB 10-Year Battery Ana-Digi Bracelet Watch did not, reviewed separately., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Wear it all the time!, Watch is exactly as it is shown in the picture..would definitely recommend.., Really large on the arm but that's what I wanted - thx!, I receive many compliments on this watch once people figure out how to read it.  :0)  I am a lover of interesting, different watches and this fit the bill!  I am loving it!, I instantly fell in love with this watch when I saw it. There is no doubt this is one of the best bang for buck watches available. Its not like the wanna be brands. Its well made by the people who know watches and it uses its own in house movement which everyone is talking about but ONLY ONE thing disappoint me that is Strap :((.<br />If strap is not a big deal for you as me, and want a good watch which people will admire and most importantly in your heart you know that its an original and genuine product, go for it. Its not about the money its about the value. Cheers. I highly recommend., Works as expected with a canvas band much more comfortable that what I expected.  Easy to read dial.  For $50 this is hard to beat., I got this watch winder in a bad condition (chipped at corners)and the reason; it was not properly packaged but regardless of physical issue the following were my concern too:<br />1- There is an option in the winder that makes the turn clockwise and counter clockwise every few minutes automatically which wasn't working (may be it was because of the not-properly packaged or throwing the package or falling down....)<br />2- On the description in Amazon add, it says glossy wood finish watch winder, so I thought it has a plastic face and glossy wood body, but actually the whole body is made by plastic and it is wood effect not wood finish. I think they should change the add to \\\\\"Glossy Wood effect\\\\\" because it makes confusion.<br /><br />I was not satisfy of the product, so I returned it!, Awesome pc, Whatever.., I don't know what a standard woman's wrist is but this will not fit any wrist larger than 5&#34;.  Very disappointed!, Bought this for my dad. It has a nice large face and easy to read too. It also has a button to light up the face to see it in the dark., I can't give it as a gift because the box is damaged. Very disappointed., NOT a Grand Seiko - do not buy at this price.<br /><br />Don't know if the poster realizes is, but the watch pictured is NOT a Grand Seiko., And low cost eliminates worries if lost or damaged., Little knob to change the time wouldn't stay on or turn the hands correctly and knob was lost quickly., Returned because it was so difficult to open the band. Have to put finger under the band to open.<br />Currently own a Guess watch with similar band - push tabs on the side & it springs open., Handsome watch, easy to set, but DH could not read the numbers day or night.  Had to return it., This watch face is lovely and a quality piece of jewelry; however, the band is nothing to write home about.  I am glad the price of the watch was low, because I will need to replace the band.  The band where it goes through the pins is just folded over and glued.  I'm afraid that with sweat or very much daily wear, it would come apart and the watch would fall to the floor and possibly break, or worse yet, be lost.<br /><br />Keeping time does not seem to be an issue, and the movement is smooth.  The design is what attracted me to the piece and it is truly lovely.  If you make this purchase, just plan on either not wearing it often, or replacing the band so you can wear it more frequently.<br /><br />I would still recommend this watch at this price point., Watch arrived on time (!) It's comfortable and easy to read. I had what may have been age-related difficulty setting it--crown hard to pull out and the date square is too tiny for me to see. Nevertheless it meets my needs, so I'm happy., The watch broke the first day I wore it., Everything was going fine, until today.  The watch month dial jumped to Nov. ( it's still Aug ) so therefore, the date is all messed up., The best for your money, Slow shipping, wrong item., I received this watch yesterday.  It is very attractive and classy but the face is pale gold and the minute and the second hands are pale gold so they blend each into the other and you just cannot tell the time.  This is a major fault in this watch.  I am uncertain if its the one I purchased or if its a fault in this type and style., Solid watch, though leather feels a bit fake., This thing is awesome. I'd never had an Invicta watch before, and certainly not one this large.  However, I've had it a few weeks and I've grown very attached to wearing it.  Until now it's only be Fossil and Timex brands for me.  The people I work with noticed it the very first day.  It's a large and in charge watch that also becomes a conversation piece when all else fails.<br /><br />I'd read lots of reviews from watch snobs who said the Invicta brand was cheap and didn't quite have the quality of watches that cost 5-10 times more than this watch.  I took all of that into consideration and I still purchased this watch.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'll be honest here, the reason I went looking for a better watch was because the watch I'd be wearing was so small compared to what my colleagues and management were wearing.  I studied the various sizes closely to make sure what I bought would fit my wrist based on my size and how I usually dress for work.<br /><br />Let me break it down a bit:<br /><br />Me:  5'9&#34;, large guy, 8&#34; wrist (possibly 8.5&#34;).  I wear a watch every day - at work and at home.  I don't dive, but didn't care - I liked the diver watches anyway.<br /><br />Initial impressions:  This watch is nice to look at and definitely catches the eye of others around you.  I'm usually not a &#34;flashy gold&#34; kind of guy but this is just enough to make a statement without looking like you are a rapper.<br /><br />Quality & Feel:  It's heavy compared to my other watches.  Larger, too.  It feels substantial on my wrist but I quickly got used to it being there.  The band is solid and has &#34;Invicta&#34; inscribed on one side and &#34;Grand Diver&#34; on the other.  It also has those porthole diver men on the north/south side of the face.  The crown sticks out a good amount.  The diver dial on the top is solid and clicks as you move it.  It's not flimsy at all - very sturdy.<br /><br />Movement:  I studied this a bit before purchasing.  The one I received had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.  Maybe all the newer models have that same movement - but I did read some articles where Invicta had been using a different movement in it.  Anyway, I like this automatic thing.  I wear the watch almost daily and it stays wound all on it's own.  Also, the underside of the watch has a clear window in it where you can see how it winds itself.  It's very nice and has a yellow part that swings about that has script writing on it.<br /><br />Setting the watch:  This was fairly simple.  I *did* have a problem figuring out how to set the date, but once I read the instructions (duh) it was fairly simple.  To save you time, you just unscrew the crown, pull it out one level (out of two) and dial in the date you want.  One note!!  I was an idiot and didn't pay attention to what time of day it was when I set the date, so I found the thing not changing the date when I expected it to, and then changing midday when I didn't want it to.  Since this watch does not show &#34;AM / PM&#34; , you kind of guess at the time of day when you set it.  Just move the clock forward 12 hours if yours is changing at the wrong time.  You'll figure it out.<br /><br />Sizing:  Ok, so even with an 8-8.5&#34; wrist, I had to remove links.  Ultimately I removed 4 links, but that made the watch a bit too snug for me, so I'll be adding one back in shortly.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this, or any other Grand Diver you happen to like.  I'm happy with it and considering the price point, I felt like it was a good balance between cost, quality, features, and style.eceived had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.

It was delivered just when Amazon said it would arrive and he was very pleased with it. The band however proved to be a little too tight as my son has a larger than average wrist.<br /><br />He contacted Seiko's customer service dept. and they quickly mailed him 3 additional links free. Only two were needed, but now he also has a replacement should one ever break.<br /><br />Seiko is a well respected brand, and their customer service reflects that reputation. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of their products again., The watch stopped. Too late to return to Amazon (past 30 days). Have written to the manufacturer but have not gotten a reply., As expected, This is my third citizen watch, first review. I will be keeping short and simple. There is nothing else you would want on a watch, it has all of the essentials without breaking your wallet. I see people wearing name brand watches that need their batteries replaced, some sub par glass materials, and you have to set the correct date every time the month falls short of 31 days and it's all for about the same price as this beauty. If youre looking for a classy time piece and don't mind the dual tone design this is your watch. You will not be disappointed. I gave it four stars due to the dual tone design,  other than that is a magnificent time piece., My watch was one of the ones with very tight back that won't open no matter how many different house tools I try.<br />So I was worried if this little product would really open it, and guess what, it did  the job!, Very nice watch for running because of the large display.  Good for &#34;old guys&#34; whose vision is no longer what it used to be.  😉, A little large, but very pretty, and lots of detail, Great watch,however, it just doesn't go with the outfit I originally bought it for. Reason being is, it's a totally &#34;different color&#34; blue. I needed navy blue to go with my fourth of July outfit. Very disappointing. .., My son loves his watch.  He has no problems with the band being too small (he is seven and the band is as tight as it will go) and he doesn't have any problem with it itching as some others have mentioned.  The hour and minute hands are labeled which helps him with learning to tell time., If you buy one oil... this should last you for a very very long time., Ok but too thin in width., I have the same watch in black, brown and red, and was looking forward to adding blue to my collection. However, this watch color is closer to black than blue.  I truly thought it would be a lighter blue than what I received.  I still love the Victorinox product just not the color of this particular watch., This is my favorite alarm clock., Love my watch ! Looks good , easy to read and use . Only thing i dont like is i dont understand how to use the alarm and sometimes when im working the buttons hits surfaces and against my wrist and start the stop watch or alarm or changes the time but other than that its perfect ! Yes it is waterproof !, ok, All I needed was one 25mm spring. Could not find anywhere. Much easier to order and wait for it to arrive. Now have many spares. Good quality., Fast shipping. Accurate product info., I really love these watches. I've been getting so many compliments, and the best part is, they did not cost too much., Buyer beware. This is a Quartz watch not an Automatic. Made in China. Not Swiss made., I got my watch about a month ago. It was delivered on schedule and is as described. I love it and I wear it everyday., Many economically-oriented watches on the market are either big, gawdy, blingy, littered with non-functional dials or downright aesthetically unpleasant. The Susenstone Wood Grain watch is none of that. The wood grain watch face is simply but provides a pleasant contrast against the black lettering of the watch. The movement itself is silent and accurate. The crystal surface is clear and free of defects, as is the shiny-brown stainless steel watch body. Straps are made of wood-grained leather though they do come from the factory feeling rather stiff, hence why I have it wrapped around a watch case cushion to help it form a more natural shape. Note the while needles are NOT photoluminiscent and you will not be able to read this watch in the dark, although that hardly seems to matter since this is more of a fashion watch as opposed to a multi-functional watch. I am very pleased to add this watch to my collection at a discount for review!, Just purchased this watch. I have the rangeman and frogman and many other casio watches. The mudmaster is the best yet., Great watch strap, only complaint was that there wasn't enough adjustment holes on the band itself my wrist is small, but I was able to make a new hole and now it fits perfectly, the best watch I've owned so far! long lasting battery and the LED time generator is so visible that you can still see it in night time!, Fantastic sport watch used it recently during a climb. I could read the time in the middle of hot sunny day with no problem-I have the black on black model. Easy to program with the instruction booklet. U small wrists and the band fits comfortably not to tight or loose with room to go either way. Would love this even more if it was resin and metal band like a white baby g model I bought a few years ago, but love this one and it's better than I had imagined and comes with a tin case., The watch is great but the belt are to short, I have big hands and it just wont make around my wrist, I need a extra long wrist belt., This was a gift sent to a family member.  I received an acknowledgment of receipt, but not an opinion of whether they liked, or disliked this item.  Sorry I cannot give you a true rating on this item., The watch broke after less then a week of use. Don't buy., The two tone wrist band takes everything away from this item. I had to return this item.., It is OK.  Light is only bright half of the watch., I ordered this watch about a month ago. I like the looks of it and the ability to change the back ground to numerous different colors, the bad thing is the buttons are a little to big, my wrist sweats from the rubber watch band and I don't know how it happened but I just noticed that have already cracked the crystal, right across the middle!, Bought this for my 10 year old son. I have been pleased with the watch., Watch arrived quickly and in perfect condition, was just as advertised. Love the grey and blue color way. Had to return because it was just a little too big on my little wrist. Wish i could find it in a ladies smaller version., I've used them a few times now and it pays to have the right tool for the job.<br />Holding up well., Leather belt broke as shown in the paint , two weeks of use, Ok so the watch is really cute but it was smaller than i expected, was going to give to my bf but it seemed better suited for a woman. Not sayin a man couldnt wear it tho, just tryna give an idea about the size. I dont think the face is real wood, and that was a bit of a let down since that's what seemed to make the watch. But i still think its cute so 3 stars, Best watch EVER!, I have been researching Casio rangeman's for two years and this watch fulfills my criteria. The carbon fiber band is light and durable, the watch is somber and somewhat accurate for its functions. I was pleasantly surprised that with Premium Japan's quick delivery, and the packing with the watch. It is more expensive than the base model and my friend is just as satisfied with his base model. This watch suits a particular person criteria more than as general purchase or gift.<br /><br />Like<br />The negative display and other features listed<br /><br />Disliked<br />I can't seem to work out how to set the light to last more than 2 seconds for the display. It is missing some functions from the base model in terms of programming.<br /><br />Overall Happy with my purchase because it suits my needs., Love the watch. But had to return for replacement due to defect. Hour and minute hand are misaligned.  The minute hand must reach the 12 minute mark before the hour hand is on the hour marker. Sounds trivial, but it was so obvious.  Hope to get good replacement.  I will review again. Replacement received.  No hassles.  Works perfectly. 5 Stars., The watch is a gift for my grandson and I haven't opened the box.  I am sure it will be a great gift for him., Great fishing watch for inter-coastal fishing in St. Augustine, FL. I actually set it for Porpoise Point Beach because I fish the jetties across the bay where the tide is VERY VERY swift at incoming and outgoing tides. So, this helps greatly! It is also very rugged, I go fishing offshore almost every Tuesday and for several months was fishing a minimum of twice a week. Plus, I wear it every day because it looks OK and is accurate, I have not had to reset the time since I bought it.<br /><br />I also love the fact that I don't have to change batteries, because my last Casio fishing watch (Pathfinder PAS400B-5V) battery could not be replaced without sending it to the factory...and they couldn't even tell me how much it would cost to replace it until I sent it to the factory!!! Can you believe that rip-off?! AND it may have cost more than the watch! Plus the band broke and the replacement band, once again, would cost more than the watch! (Wow, I just discovered today that the watch I bought for $25.50 now sells for $248!! So, maybe I should get the battery replaced by the factory now and buy a new band! HA!)<br /><br />Anyway, back to this watch...I was concerned about being able to see the dial it in the sunlight and also concerned about it not staying charged indoors...but I was happy to discover that neither of those concerns were a problem. In fact, I press the night light several times a night with no problem at all!<br /><br />Also, I recommend downloading the Instruction guide from online because the one that comes with the watch is so small that I could barely read it. Plus you can search items of interest with the PDF, which makes it muuuuuuch easier to learn how to use it and set it up!!!<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it does not have the &#34;best fishing times&#34; by showing small fish on it like my last Casio fishing watch (PAS400B-5V).  In fact I searched for days to find a &#34;reasonably priced&#34; fishing watch withall three fishing aids...moon, tide and best fishing times and found none! If anyone finds one at a reasonable price please reply to this and I will buy it! (But, hmmmm I am not actually sure if I can read a reply.)<br /><br />FYI: I also purchased the Casio Men's Casual Sport Watch (W753-1AV) but did not like it because I could not read the tide chart well nor the moon phase especially in sunlight. In fact, I am not even sure the tide chart worked because it never showed the correct tide. Compared to this watch, the W753-1AV is very inferior in my opinion. But oddly, I see it has high ratings by others. (But, that may be because they have not owned both to compare.)<br /><br />Good fishing!, Love this watch! Light weight well illuminated.easy to use..<br />Band is ok but hard to unlatch as the band has a locking tab which seems a bit tough to remove<br />All in all a great watch for the money!, This watch replaced my older Casio, which I had for over ten years.  Nice fit.  I use it for easy of readability and date.  The dual-time is helpful.  I just wish it had a light, like my old one., My husband is very happy with it.  Easy to read., New Variety Watch, Original strap on my Alessi lasted about two years.  This replacement lasted less than six months.  It's cheap and tears easily, especially if moist., I got a few watches that I wear from time to time... Lol but I'm definitely hook on this one., get all kinds of compliments, I received this watch yesterday and automatically I wore it since I had two events to go to. My first impression of this watch,  very elegant and classy design. Love the beautiful color wristband. I was super excited to be wearing my new watch, until I actually went to put it on, too big for a small wrist, it only has 6 holes to adjust size, I needed to make 2 more so it could fit me. As the night went on, I needed to keep sliding down the strap to hold it in place, that unfortunately lead to the strap holder from detaching itself. Other than it being a pretty watch, I really feel the wristband quality is very cheap, but it's definitely one of those items that you get for what you pay type of thing. I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review., My husband loves the big, easy-to-read numbers on this watch. It is his go-to work watch because he can read the face without his glasses. He also has a Timex Ironman multi-lap/memory watch that he uses for running, but this is more ideal for day-to-day use. This is the second one that I have purchased for him in the past 10 years (normal wear-and-tear for him includes a broken band, scratched face and that general worn-out look, so we shopped for a new one and were delighted to find the same version still available). He loves it., All the best to say about this well made watch. Durable, works well and accurately. Very happy with this purchase., Okay, This is a nice watch, for the price. And, the blue face just adds to its appeal. However, the watch band is tight on my wrist, which measures 7 3/4 inches. To solve this problem, I called Armitron and made a complaint about this matter.<br /><br />Armitron's response was that they're going to send three links, for free, to expand the size of this watch band.<br /><br />It's a small inconvenience. But, it's worth it, in my opinion., I've had good experiences with Seiko watches over the years, so when my old (non-Seiko) died, I picked this model both because of its classic looks, its day/date display, and because my interest was piqued by the built-in solar-recharging for the battery, especially since this last feature added little or no cost compared to the direct non-solar competition.  Thus far, I like this watch a lot; it's solid, attractive, massive enough to feel like quality but not so heavy as to be a burden, and its size both suits my wrist and is neither too small to easily read the time nor so large that it catches on or bangs against things. My only complaint would be that my aging eyes would appreciate a larger day/date display, hence the deletion of one star; too often I must squint at it to make out what the day is (is that a 26 or a 28?) It's far too early (only 4 months so far) to judge how much savings there will be in batteries due to the solar charging feature, but if I get at least 5 years out of the original battery, I'll be happy (usually they last one to one and a half years each in non-rechargeable watches)., I have received a lot of compliments with my pocket watch. Would buy again!, Nice swatch with a crappy plastic strap! I will buy a new strap!, I'm glad I bought this Watch and I'm happy with the price : ), This is a decent tool that (eventually) allowed us to do the necessary repairs on our watches. The space that holds the watch bands is almost large enough to fit most of our watches, although a few of my husband's watches were too wide to fit in the space. It comes with extra replacement bars and pins which was very nice since a couple have already broken. The biggest disappointment was that the first time we used this tool, it broke. It literally just snapped in half. Thankfully we were able to super glue it back together and we haven't had any problems using it since. The glue seems to be holding it together just fine, but it's really not fun to have an item break the first time you use it. So overall, the quality isn't fantastic, but we made it work and have been able to adjust the bands of several watches with it., This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />This is a FANTASTIC watch! I purchased the white one, which seems to be no longer listed, but it came in a sleek black box<br />The leather feels real, with plenty of adjustable notches (it fits me well) and has another loop to thread the excess strap through which I appreciate a LOT (so that the excess strap doesn't get in your way or bent back and forth)<br />It's light, and clearly high quality - simple and stylish and minimalist<br />I've already received several compliments, and it matches everything!<br />You won't regret buying it!, This watch is for extremely small wrists! Unfortunately, I won't be able to wear it., As expected, This is a very solid, well made watch. It comes in a nice box and is very well packaged to protect the watch from damage. The face and band are completely covered in peel off plastic to protect it. The watch is turned off and cannot be turned on until you remove a plastic piece below the middle dial on the right side. After removing the plastic insert the watch immediately began running. The color is a dark charcoal (not quite black I think) -- it has just a hint of metallic in the color keep it from being jet-black. The other ring rotates for time zones.<br /><br />I found the watch to be a bit heavier than I expected from the look. The face piece is about the same as a modern large cellar linked watch like a Samsung, Motorola, or iWatch. The price is such that it is about in the same range as the Motorola 360.<br /><br />It's a nice watch, but I don't think it is as simple as I prefer and the metal band is not as comfortable as a well fitted leather band. That said the steel band will certainly last longer than any leather band. My preference is still the Moto 360 watch which weighs less and obviously has far more features., came broken in 3 pieces, Fine, Kinda a big face and uncomfortable on my wrist while lifting, Scratches easily:(, I have a couple Swiss Legend watches and really like the quality that they put into their products. This watch is a very attractive one with day, date and time zone adjustable and a stopwatch feature. I needed the manual to figure out all the setup, but it worked out just fine and it is running great. This is a very large and heavy watch. That is how I prefer them, but be warned!<br /><br />I prefer metal bands, and this one is a nice one, but I don't like the way it latches. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is not as easy to latch as other watches  I own. It also requires an extremely tiny screwdriver to take out links on the band (this one was a bit too large for my wrist), so that could require a stop to a local jewelry store to have the band adjusted. I tend to feel awkward asking a jewel to adjust a watch I bought online... Otherwise a great watch and one  I will wear regularly., could not get pass shoulders, I have a hard time seeing the screen, the numbers are too light. The buttons are confusing. This would be good for a young kids that just needs a watch. I wanted to use it for running, but since I can't see it well in the sun, no good. Plus I couldn't get the times working right. Miss my old Nike watch that broke., The watch on the photo so orange,real thing is ok., Great value for a very nice watch.Several people thought it was a Rolex. Only minor complaint is band is a little tight on my wrist. It came adjusted all the way out. Still a little tight., This is a fun, inexpensive, waterproof, watch that just works and does more than you expect. For the price, I have no qualms with the quality. Right on the face, you can see the date and day, time, seconds, and whether you have an alarm on. It has a timer mode, backlight button, and is pretty easy to set too. In fact it took me about as long to figure out how to get the instructions out of the watch stand as it did to learn how to work the watch (stupid plastic stand).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-shows  a lot of information in one glance--again day, date, time, pm, seconds, which alarms are on. Then there's a ton of quick stuff available: timer, 2nd timezone, stopwatch, alarm, hourly chime.<br />-easy to work, you press button B (lower left) to cycle through modes: SP (stopwatch), AL (alarm set), TR (countdown timer set), T2 (second timezone). You press the C button (upper right) to start/stop/advance. You hold the A button (upper left) to change things (TR, AL, T2, regular settings). May sound complicated, but after you play around with it for five minutes while staring at the little instructions and cursing for the first two minutes it really does makes sense!<br />-jelly styling is pretty retro cool--the twelve year old in you will love it, but you'll think it's pretty cool too...<br />-wears nice and is comfortable<br />-cheap--doesn't cost much for what feels like a quality device<br />-backlite works well and just lights the information which looks cool<br /><br />cons:<br />-cheap-I would prefer Japanese quartz movement to the Chinese quartz movement that this is, but it keeps time so far which is the point<br />-The watch face is convex and I think it's just plastic which makes me think it's going to get scratched up very easily. I would prefer a convex watch so it's harder to scratch the face<br />-the warranty is kinda a joke. It's a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for the shipping and include a check for $9.95. You might as well buy another watch at the cost of the warranty! But the watch is so cheap, and seems to be well made, that I'm not knocking it at this time. I really wish there was some length of the warranty that you did not need to send the check (if it has issues in the first 90 days you don't have to send the check--but it doesn't work this way). I guess if it breaks quickly, you call Amazon!<br />-battery is pretty easy to replace, but most jewelers will help you too<br /><br />We like it a lot. My wife likes it and is wearing it now. I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!cost of the warranty! But the watch is so cheap, and seems to be well made, that I'm not knocking it at this time. I really wish there was some length of the warranty that you did not need to send the check (if it has issues in the first 90 days you don't have to send the check--but it doesn't work this way). I guess if it breaks quickly, you call Amazon!<br />-battery is pretty easy to replace, but most jewelers will help you too<br /><br />We like it a lot. My wife likes it and is wearing it now. I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!, Broke the strap on my black one and went buy new pins and seen this watch. Had to have it!, Ok, I have had it some time now.  The crystal still has no scratches.  The watch is incredibly light and durable. I love the watch!, Exactly as promised, Don't waste your money, Love this watch! Very easy to read the time,very comfortable and light weight. Got tons of compliments 1st day wearing it!, Very nice looking watch. I would rate it 5 stars except tht the crown extends below the case and catches easily on pants pocket when reaching for keys, change, etc. When withdrawing hand, the crown catches and pulls the stem out, effectively stopping the watch. This stem does seem to pull much more easily than other Fossil watches I own., Watch works fine. Bought it &#34;used: like new&#34;. However, it arrived damaged.  One of the crystal stones in the band had fallen out. Should be an easy fix at a jewelry repair place, but still is an extra hassle. Band should have 3 stones. Bottom link next to the face only had 2, dial is hard to read and band fell apart after two weeks of use, This Casio Solar-Powered Digital Watch has been around in one form or another since the 1980s and is still one of the best low-cost digital watches on the market ... assuming you aren't a cave dweller who never leaves your basement.<br /><br />As the name suggests, this is a 100% solar-powered digital watch; you never have to buy one of those stupid little watch batteries again. Electrical power comes from a small bank of solar panel cells that feed electrical current to a capacitor inside the watch. The capacitor essentially acts as a battery and as long as you allow the solar panel cells to absorb some light every day the capacitor will stay charged and keep your watch running perfectly.<br /><br />The biggest &#34;problem&#34; with this watch is the unfortunately long initial charge cycle for the capacitor (an unavoidable flaw in having a battery-free design). The capacitor is completely dead when you first remove the watch from the box, and since the digital components require a &#34;relatively&#34; large amount of voltage the capacitor can't keep up with the demand until it is FULLY charged. This means you have to leave the watch out in the sun (with minimal cloud cover or shade) for a full day and then still charge it under a BRIGHT lamp indoors after the sun goes down for a full night before the capacitor has the charge needed to get started.<br /><br />There is a little &#34;sun&#34; icon that appears below the time if the capacitor is running low. Even after the sun icon disappears during the first day of charging you STILL have to leave the watch out to charge (again a full day of sunlight and a full night of bright lamp light at least) for that first charge.<br /><br />After the capacitor has received a full initial charge you won't have to worry about charging it again as long as you spend at least 45-90 minutes outside every day and the solar panel isn't covered by your shirt sleeve. An hour to an hour and a half of sunlight is all this watch needs to keep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night. Granted, even a single low-voltage LED would drain the capacitor VERY quickly and defeat the purpose of having a battery-free watch, but it would have been nice to have a light. I suppose I'm willing to put up with the lack of a light if it means I never have to buy another watch battery and never have to remove the cover from the back of this watch.<br /><br />If a solar-powered and battery-free digital watch sounds like a good idea to you then you'll absolutely love this watch. Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs.eep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night.

Thank God for kids!, The battery life of this watch has been mentioned so frequently in past reviews for being mediocre or bad but I'm glad to say after a few software updates, the Moto 360 can easily last through a typical day with some to spare. It's not without drawbacks though, to survive the day you will need to use it without the ambient screen on, and that slight delay between raising your wrist up and the screen turning on can be frustrating to some.<br /><br />Having come from a Pebble, not having an always-on display needs some getting used to. While the accelerometer does it's job well in detecting your arm movement to turn on the screen; at times say when you are sitting at a desk and need a quick glance at the time, you'll need to wake the watch up by tapping the screen or pressing the side button - unintuitive.<br /><br />The vibration motor on the Moto 360 is also fairly weak compared to the Pebble, I have missed several notifications because I couldn't feel the vibration. Then again, your experience might vary.<br /><br />Despite being powered by an old TI Omap processor, the watch performs decently with the latest software update. The watch might feel a little sluggish during the first few seconds after turning on the screen but that is definitely not a deal-breaker in my opinion, during normal use it's snappy.<br /><br />Fitness tracking is normal, nothing fancy. However, as mentioned in many other reviews, the heart rate sensor requires you to stay still for it to take a reading, so if you are planning to do some running with HR tracking you will have to look elsewhere. Not having a GPS built-in means you'll need to be tethered to your phone when you go out and hit the road.<br /><br />Overall the Moto 360 is a fairly good buy at $149, considering the LG G Watch R costs twice as much. While it looks pretty, being one of the first Android Wear device means it come with it's own fair share of flaws as well. However, if you can live with these flaws that I've mentioned above (not many), and are looking to buy a smartwatch without breaking the bank, this is a safe bet. It is a beautiful smartwatch that will turn some heads on the street and few might come up to you and ask if that's an Apple Watch.<br /><br />p.s. The successor to the Moto 360 should be announced soon so you might want to think twice before hitting that add to cart button., Amazing! Just what I wanted., I love my Vestal Brig! The tides are very accurate, and it's got a lot of settings inside that are helpful. I've gotten so many compliments on it!! Couldn't ask for a better watch., Yes, Putting things in context, I have an Apple Watch, Microsoft Band, and 3 MIO Fitness Bands. I'm only mentioning this because, in the price range of the SMARTE, it is decent value within a somewhat narrow universe of buyers.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The One Feature That Makes It Worthwhile to One Subgroup<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Right off the bat, the biggest benefit is that streams notifications -- as long as you have an Android phone. My primary phone is currently a iPhone 6 Plus. But I was able to test this using my old LG G2 and, sure enough, notifications from apps that were able to limp along on Wifi only came through on this watch after I paired.<br /><br />Why is this such a big deal? Well, what gets me paying attention phone are notifications, i.e. text messages, emails and reminders. As has been the case with my Microsoft Band, which I use more than the Apple Watch, because the battery drain is less of a hassle, I can be more selective about the instances in which I'll take my phone out of my pocket because I can see it on my watch.<br /><br />So now, you can that at a low price point, as long as you're on an Android phone.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Rest of Story...Not as Quite as Impressive<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In most other instances, the SMARTE Watch in not in same league of high tier watches such the Apple, Microsofts, and LGs...or even mid-tier smart watches such as the Pebbles, Samsungs, and Jawbones. It has non-HD screen that will seem pretty retro compared with you low resolution compared along-side your phone. When I say retro, I don't mean Game Boy retro, which is viewed as hip in some circles. I mean retro as in Palm Pilot (although in color).<br /><br />Other impressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is. It's got a nice band with rubber texture. Adjustable too ...I think it fit most wrists. Since it goes into power save mode and your screen is off most of the time people can really tell what it is until you turn the screen on.<br />♦ It's got a touch screen, which allow you access all it's function, such as: time, date, calculator, and pedometer. However, I did not find the touch screen to be as responsive the smart phones have been for the past three years.<br /><br />To be fair, my review is in the context of Android phone uses because of the notifications. iPhone uses should probably not consider it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon does not have rating available, I'll give it four stars.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogicpressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is.

The face is actually a bit more gray that I expected, instead of the black it appears to be online.  I had a different version of this same watch for about 10 years, so I opted to stick with it., [[VIDEOID:dae27737f337c776423c7999c6781874]]This BUREI watch is an attractive quartz movement watch. The watch is classy and elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 8.25\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8.5\\\\\".<br /><br />The watch's face is 1.5\\\\\" wide and the watch is 3/8\\\\\" thick.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so you need to match your dial to one in the photo to get the details on how to set various options.<br /><br />The first position of the crown allows to adjust days of the month.<br />The second position of the crown allows to change time.<br />To select the day of the week I need to rotate the time until the right day appears in the display window.  This is a bit time consuming as to go to the next day you need to rotate through 24 hours.  If you miss it you cannot go backwards to you can only go forward.<br /><br />The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing, but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, I have this watch, and it is my everyday watch. It's fantastic. Very attractive.<br /><br />Incredibly sturdy-the sapphire crystal is much thicker than in most watches, making it very strong. Part of where it get's is waterproof rating from.<br /><br />One of the best but least appreciated features of this watch is that it almost never needs to be opened. Opening the watch can destroy the water seal, and even a new O-ring may not fully restore it. But since there is no maintenance needed on this watch, and no batteries to replace, it just does not need to be opened. Heck,if it weren't for Daylight Savings Time, you would not even need to loosen the crown!<br /><br />I do put it outside one day a year, in full sun, to make sure it is really charged up. And as others have pointed out, in the dark, the second hand stops, to save energy. In fact, the manual says that if it is in the dark for long enough, and the battery gets low, the hour and minute hands will stop also, but the watch will continue to keep time.<br /><br />I do wish it was a touch larger, but other than that, I know of no other watch I would rather wear. I have an Omega, and a couple of other watches, but this is on my wrist 99% of the time., contacted seller about watch ,hour and minutes hands not moving, the second hand advanced around,but the minutes hand of the watch does not move therefore the hour hands does not move which leads to the watch not keeping time....., Outstanding. Get compliments on it for such a cheap watch.  My expensive watches broke or died and this works well. Had one in black but the wrist strap slid broke. I use it in my desk as  desk clock. Love the blue. Wish it was Ravens purple., I love the watch, but disappointed it didn't come with instructions on how to change the date., Very nice low profile watch. Super comfotable., if it says g-shock, you can't go wrong! this watch is great, nothing bad about it! i have the red trim & orange trim models of this watch. g-shock is all i buy now =), I installed this watch band two weeks ago on the watch I wear every day.  Yesterday I noticed that the band segment with the notches is fraying and appears to be falling apart.  I have purchased replacement bands previously through Amazon for this watch and have not had similar experiences but this one is a defective product., Don't waste your money. The thing fell apart on me while I was on a date. I mean literally fell off of my wrist onto the floor. Can you say embarrassing......and while ur at it CHEAP!!!!!, Decent quality watchband, but definitely very long!  Measure your wrist!, Great coffee, and the pods correspond perfectly with my Nespresso machine. Will definitely buy again, either this flavor or another one., I received this product as pictured and advertised.  It was safely packaged and undamaged.  The craftsmanship is nothing but, EXCELLENT.  Wolf have been building these watch boxes since 1834, and their experience with the trade shows on their products.<br /><br />This particular box utilizes a nice thick viewing glass.  The hinges and lock are built solid.  The lock is slightly tight and firm to turn, but gives a good sense of security.  The stitching of the leather around the box is precise.  The black pebble faux leather and the silver textured silk lining looks, feels, and smell so elegant.  There are ample amount of room for my 47mm and 49mm Dive watches as well as ample space between the viewing glass and top of my 13mm Dive watches.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this box knowing it is built to last and it will display my watch collection with style., Tide and compass hard to figure out., Wonderfull, Item just as described!!!, I received a balloon instead of the clock Bad never I buy more, It is a not expensive watch for that the quality is more and less, I love the look and feel of this watch....but I've had two and both times the strap pins snapped. My biggest beef Freestyle is you can't just order more straps. You literally have to contact their CS depo, pay $17.00 for the straps, and then another $5 for shipping., I recently purchased this watch as my everyday time piece. Shipping and delivery was fast. The watch is beautiful. I love the gunmetal color. Although it's nothing elaborate, I get plenty of compliments over my watch. I've only had it a few days to a week so i havent had any issues. The only issue I have is that it's a snug fit on my wrist., Works for me and simple to use. Only downside is that I cannot screw in any pieces on the top half - it falls right off. But it's still usable nonetheless. Changing my own watch batteries saves me more money than getting price gouged by local mall jewelers for a task so simple and cheap., Pros<br />• Decent size and weight (actually feels like a solid watch)<br />• Face and chronographs are easy to read (numbers)<br />• Sleek colorway with nice polished chrome accents (noticeable on the wrist)<br />• The buttons on the side of the bezel are non-intrusive (could be worn on either wrist)<br />• Fairly easy to understand, straight forward instructions (nice manual included)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for sizing (could fit varying wrist sizes)<br />• Invicta always have good packaging (sturdy box with soft felt liner)<br /><br />Cons<br />• The color of the band and bezel seem like a cheap coating (chip easily if banged up)<br />• The watch clasp seems cheap, compared the rest of the watch (MSRP $1000)<br />• Curious why there is a date window and date chronograph (seems repetitive)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for smaller wrists, leaves you with one link on each side (could offer more removable links or wider links)<br />• TritNite Night Glow doesn't last that long (even with prolonged sunlight exposure)<br />• Comprehensive manual isn't model specific (general instructions for wide range of models), this its a piece of s*** dont buy the clasp broke the same day i got it!!!!!!!!!!!! i repeat your wasting your time!!!!!!!!, It is a very large watch with very large buttons., The band was  loose  upon arrival. Shipped back to company., Seems to be a good product. A little larger than my other watches but still conformable ., It's big.  It's heavy.  It's awesome! The battery works great.  The band was very large and needed to be re-sized, which is very simple using a jeweler's punch.  Love it!, I got this watch yesterday and immediately put it on. Have not taken it off since then. It's comfortable, small and practical. It was pretty easy to set up and for $11 I have more I could wish for, even an alarm and light. As a busy mom of two I think this will do the job perfectly. Oh yeah... AND it is waterproof, very important lol!, Cute clock for decoration purposes only. I got my boys each an alarm clock for their separate rooms and they sleep right through the alarm. Then the alarm turns off after a few seconds. I am returning them and getting clocks with louder alarms., Bought this for my son for christmas.  he loved the Batman logo and that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  He also likes that he can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way he could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when he is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., Got about 1 month out of it before it died, When working on delicate machines such as watches, it's important to have proper, good quality tools.  This Case Wrench is well made.  High enough quality to keep the repair from damaging the case., I love this watch!! I have 3 of them in different colors! They are good quality watch faces,  however you might want to get a different band that is a better quality than the one that is on the watch. I get a lot of attention and compliments whenever I where it!, Excelente!!!, Teenage son purchased for his &#34;swag&#34;. It's very heavy, but he loves it. Fast shipping!, this product came broken and when i went to get it fixed nobody could help me, I remember first having this watch when I was around 7. Now that I'm 34 I went onto Amazon and got this same style watch. There is something special about the simplicity of this watch. Now-a-days everything is about the next big thing (Apple watch, android watch, etc. etc), which don't get me wrong, is fine.... But having the reliability of this F-91W on your wrist will go far and beyond what any new wearable can get you. For the price you can't beat it. You'll have a watch that will be maintenance free for more than 5-6 years. Exactly how it should be., As presented, quick delivery., The watch is nice and the price is great.  I just am skeptical because the Timex box it came in was tampered with.  Part of the box was cut out and I wonder why.  I have resubmitted my review because there is now a problem with the watch band.  A pin came out of the band and now the band it detached.  The pin must have come out while wearing the watch and now it cannot be worn without some repair work.  I did not get 3 months use from this watch., Got the mudman as a replacement for my lost rangeman, this review will contrast the two. I thought the lack of an additional sensor and bells and whistles from the rangeman would impact the watches performance. However, I can say that I prefer this watch because for me the watch face is more readible (less cluttered) and the watch is easier to operate. There are no accidental mode changes from the mode button mashing into my wrist, a common fault I found with the rangeman. As always, the mudman is a fantastic g-shock watch with all the quality you'd expect. Compass and moon phase function without error. For the price I dont think I would pick another watch. Would purchase again., Cheap... It's turning yellow, This band's pin to hold it in place of the watch face is too sm to fit the Timex Indiglo watch that I own. It is the wrong size and I need to replace the pin., I like the subtle grey on black military look instead of the loud color models, but that's me. Not intuitive configuration and needed 20 minutes with the manual to set it and understand it. Haven't used a watch in 12+ years but it's a pain to dig out a phone to see the time when a flick of the wrist in a third of a second can tell me. Mineral glass should keep it lasting for years. Auto calendar good until 2099. +/- 30 seconds a month accuracy. Alarm tone is loud enough without being blaring although I doubt it would wake most people. Manual says 10 months of battery assuming 18 hours of display and 6 hours of sleep (it goes to sleep in dark conditions to conserve, light and hitting a button wakes it). ONLY the small digital display lights up so don't think you can use this to walk down a dark hallway. The analog hands are moved by magnetic force so that part of the timekeeping will be affected if you have the watch near magnets and you'll need to re-adjust. It isn't a G-Shock so big impacts or wearing it while using a chainsaw could cause it to malfunction. All in all a great watch to survive daily life if you don't need extra features., Add my name to the list of purchasers who know 1/1/2005 is a Saturday. And that I'm on Easter/NYC time although I live near Chicago., Low quality for the price, i was expecting more from guess, but arrived on time., Very nice watch could be set a little better but overall a plus, Good quality and service! The only two issues were the color with finish of Ebony we would call it more of a Rosewood or Mahogany.finish. It has more tones in it.<br />And my wife's wrist is small, so it would be great if it included a smaller rubber spacer, along with two which are included. Besides this it functions great!, I bought this watch many years ago and I'm still wearing it every day. I love this watch and I get compliments on it often. The solar cell means it never stops provided you wear it every couple of days. Just bought a replacement strap and it feels like a new watch. Simple, elegent, solid, reliable. 10/10 would watch again., this watch came yesterday, no box just in a baggy. that being said the clasp was a nightmare to figure out but once I got it, I realized how versatile it is and it's a great buy for the price., Awsome watch I live big pretty watches so this fits my style, Very nice for business or evening. Good quality. Band runs large, buen producto!!, This is a pretty big watch but it's still cool. My (thin) 10 year old grandson has to put it on the last notch of the band but at least it fits. We've only had it a few days so hope it lasts., First, this is a very light and wearable watch. About the thinnest I could find in a day/date automatic with 200m ISO dive rated watch.<br /><br />Loved the watch until the second time I actually went diving with it (about the 5th time wearing it for less than a day). The diving wasn't the problem, it was after that I unscrewed the crown to adjust seconds (yes, it's a hacking movement, I also like that) and it would not, could not screw back down, no matter what I tried. Had the dive master at the shop try, another customer who had the same problem with a Tag tried. Nada. So it was no longer divable. Worse, I can't even use the watch since without screwing the crown down, there is no seal at all, even humidity would get in there. So for the price I paid and having used it for two dives and maybe five-days of wearing, this has become a monumental fail.<br /><br />Add to the fail: Mido parts (crown, stem, tube needed, according to repairer) are two-months out to get. Nice. I'm heading overseas in a matter of weeks and will be doing underwater research again, so many dive trips. NOT happy. Hopefully with this caveat I'll save others from the same fate (but hope others don't have the same experience!)<br /><br />-------------<br />Edit: Finally got it back &#34;repaired,&#34; saw the watch at the Mido dealer, inside the back it says, &#34;Hong Kong.&#34; They had to explain the case is made in China. Well..., one more dive in Thailand and, you guessed it. Something went amiss inside. Took it to a Mido repair center all the way up in Chiang Mai. They had for a week, all was well. For a few weeks. Just before flying out of Thailand I had the audacity to actually use the watch. BIG mistake. Unscrewing the crown (which had to have a new crown and tube put in, AFTER the Mido dealer in the US put a new crown and tube in - I think they knackered it, actually), the crown just came out, with the stem. Out of the watch. Completely. Great. This is the biggest POS of a &#34;Swiss watch&#34; I've ever own. Timex would be more reliable and for what I paid for this watch and all the repairs for wearing overall less than two-weeks, I could have bought enough Timex's to last me and my entire family ten-generations of time keeping. Anytime I see someone looking at a Mido, I relate this experience. Mido..., rhymes with, Yugo. Remember them, the cars that fell apart while you drove them? Same thing here..., exactly what I wanted, The watch is very comfortable to wear some bands pinch not this one. If you like stretch bands I would purchase this one. Amazon's delivery is wonderful less waiting for purchases., Love this watch!  Easy to set, really comfortable to wear and easy to read., I was very excited when this came in!! I love the size and the fit. The wristband is a little long, but other than that it's great. Super comfy. Love the face size - not too big, not too small. Perfect for work or going out, My husband happily contributes to this addiction and keeps choosing cool watches to add to the collection. I like all kinds, but in the category of giant-faced watches with fun, colorful bands, this is a new favorite of mine. I love ocean-y colors and simple designs. I also love the &#34;Indiglo&#34; feature from Timex. Which is, admittedly, kind of cheesy, but then so am I. Highly recommend this watch., The watch itself is nice! The only thing I didn't like were the light that's supposed to illuminate the digital part. I think this was a BAD design by Casio. If they fix the light and actually illuminates from the inside and not from the bottom. This would be one of the best selling watch! I would give the watch design 5 stars. Casio-Please fix the light!, Love this watch sooo retro. I was scared of the fit cuz i have small wrists but took it all the way to the last whole and it fits with a swiftness so happy! GO CASIO, Sturdy little no nonsense watch with legible face and nice light-up feature so one can see what time it is in a boring movie.  I have had several of these.  They last about 3 years until the battery runs out, The protection that these screen savers provide is awesome and it was pretty simple to apply (once I actually read the directions lol). I definitely recommend it to anyone with a Neo 2., Very satisfied., Like the watch face easy to read.  Bracelet a little large for average size wrist.  Concerned a out durability of clasp, easy off and on but delicate clasp. Appearance is great, attractive design.  Overall,  good value for cost., Extremely disappointed to receive my watch DOA something wrong with the automatic movement, no matter what I've tried it will not tick. I've purchased an orient ray last year that still works but no luck this time. it's going back to Amazon I guess it's true you get what you pay for., :), I just this watch two days ago. I got it for use when kicking and paragliding.<br /><br />I like it a lot. It's touch and functional.<br /><br />But there are some short comings:<br /><br />1) It's hard to read at low light. The light stays on for three seconds. That's okay for reading the time, but 3 seconds to read the compass, barometer and altimeter... not long enough. Along with the 3 second issue, I really wish that Casio and Timex got together for some sexy time and made one of these with &#34;Indiglow&#34; light tech.<br /><br />2) If you're an adult, it will remove all hair from your wrist... all of it. It's as if the engineers that design the watch spend most of the time and budget figuring out how to turn the band into the most efficient hair removal device ever invented. On a positive note, after only two days of wearing the watch, my wrist is as smooth as a baby's bottom... so smooth!<br /><br />3) The thermometer is supposed to tell you the temperature in the air around you. It does not. It tells you the temperature of your wrist. Removing the watch so as to get a proper temp reading, results in the removal of more hairs off your wrist. Choose your battles carefully.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I still like the watch and would recommend it to friends., Very attractive; reasonably priced; functional, bad, band broke shortly after my son started wearing it., This is a fantastic watch for the money! The blue and gold contrast has to be seen in person to be appreciated and the movement window on the back is a neat feature to see all of the gears moving., You get what you pay for. For 20 bucks, i can live with it., If you want the best / highest quality NATO strap - DaLuca is worth the money, excelente, Pretty watch but broke within a month after purchase., Perfect for day hikes and everyday use!, Smaller than I was expecting (my mistake, not theirs), but I'm very happy with the purchase.  Numbers are easy to read, which is what I wanted.  Very nice watch., Bought as a gift for my boyfriend he loves it! The only thing is the battery doesn't last for 2 days like I was under the impression before buying it, but its OK it still lasts all day before needing to be changed!, Came quickly. Huuuuge. Bigger and higher than visualized.  Too big for my wrist. Wife and don laughed at me.  I was impressed with the quality and the features, though.  I like it, but cant wear it in short sleeves. Good construction. Bought another watch at the same time for less, on amazon and get compliments on the blue polo watch., Really great! Kind of a cheap metal, but nothing I wasnt expecting for the price. Have it as a gift and he loves it., exactly what I wanted, The watch is awesome, but it came with a dead battery, just what I wanted, Very cheap and low quality item. Only lasted a month before having issues. Clock just stops so you can't rely on it to wake you up. Taking the battery out, wiggling it around, shaking it will make it start up again. But there is no way of telling how long it will run!, My father in law loved it and great price when I purchased.  My husband had one and it holds up to big hits on rocks and stuff., Sizes are right, winds right, all good.  Just make sure you have enough clearance for the adjacent keys to rotate., All what I expected, Poor quality, I returned it., Nice watch for a boy or lady. Sporty design, and easy to use. Velcro band is better against the ski. When wet and dries quickly., Band broke in Four months time. Paint chipped off inside of band. Very cheap!, Great watch , very high quality finished, up there with the big boys, I shou know have omegas and tag carera, This watch is gorgeous! My wife loved the everything, the case it comes in amazing, and the bands are all great. It's on the smaller side which is nice. Pictures do not do this watch justice at all., THESE ARE PROBABLY THE BEST EVERYDAY WATCH, Thisi is my second orders for the same watches... My daughter saw that I was wearing A black  one  and she felt in love with it!<br />She ask me to order more for her .. A difference of the other reviews on this item.. I'd dint have any problems missing stones or not working watches... So happy with my purchase., A quality watch, great presentation, superior band and, so far, very accurate.  My only negative comment is that the backlight should be for the whole watch face not just the digital readout.  At night the readout is too small especially for wearers that have reduced close-up vision., 👌👌, With kind of had a kind of it's own. Randomly alarmed even though none was set. Watch was hard to set also., Micheal kors always have great quality...I'm hard on my jewelry but Micheal Kors always stays nice..love the watch will buy it again in yellow gold.., This is a worthy investment for my new Samsung Gear 2 Neo.  After receiving my new watch as a birthday gift from my boys, I was too afraid to wear it to work.  Being in retail, I can't avoid scratching and banging the surface of my watches while stocking merchandise.  After applying one of the IQ Shield LiQuidSkins, I can see how many scratches I've already saved my watch from getting.  I've read a few negative reviews regarding a cloudy screen, but mine is crystal clear.  After the first day of use, I had a small bubble on the top of the screen that eventually went away in a day or so.  I reduced a star from my review because there is a small blemish on the top left corner of the shield.  This blemish may have been caused by mishandling, but it was there on day 1 of use so I'm not completely sure how it happened.  Regardless, I still have more shields to replace them as they are worn out, and I will definately buy more in the future to protect my beloved present., little but powerful, I'm on my third now after the first two failed. The crown on the first fell off, and water got inside the 2nd which eventually caused it to stop working. The description is confusing because it says water resistant to 99ft which is a conflicting statement. Resistance means it can survive incidental water, but a depth rating implies waterproofness, which it clearly doesn't have. I still haven't found a design I like better, so I'll keep going with them, but wish it were truly waterproof., Disappointed. It won't  keep time  or proper date.  I'm usually completely satisfied from everything out of from Amazon this is the first and only thing I am not. Thank you Amazon. Many blessings, Caroline Romanski, Now I am wishing I had gone with another choice.  This is a big watch, almost two inches across.  It is also heavier than I am used to.  The band is quite large.  I had to take a couple of links out of it.  Whoever said this was easy much have had a different model than the one I received.  I had taken links out of a Casio watch a few years ago, and that one was much easier to remove links than this one.<br /><br />Perhaps I will get used to it.  One thing I appreciate is that this one really looks water resistent.  That may come in handy., Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I own a few battery operated watches and for a couple it pops the back right open. Others would be an ordeal. I guess I need to learn how to get it in the right position. Changing my own watch batteries sure beats going to a mall jeweler and getting price gouged for a task so simple and cheap.<br /><br />Update: I tried to open one of my watch backs (again) with this tool. After trying a dozen times and having the scratches to prove it, tt's just far too fat to fit much of the blade under. I bought another tool and I hope this will do the trick., I love this watch. I bought 2 of them in different colors but my complaint is they are easily broken. I can't expect too much for the price and I have gotten pretty good at fixing my jewelry. So, cute watch at a good price just go easy on it., Huge watch...purchase if your wrist is big., I was able to successfully attach it to my Pebble (1st Gen) after removing all 4 links that you can remove. However, this smaller size is still to large for my wrist which I do not like. It is able to move around from the edge of my hand to about 2/5ths of the way down my arm (about 4&#34;). So if you have small writs, I would recommend getting something else., Like everyone else has mentioned, these just aren't quality screwdrivers.  If what you're really using them for is for repairing watches, save up and get Bergeons.  That's not meant to be an elitist statement; these just really don't work.  The bits had already fallen out or fell out soon after they arrived for most of these.  One was missing both set screws, and the others only had one installed, which also meant that the blades don't stay coaxial to the handle.  It's very easy to scratch a watch when one of these decides to drop its blade, and no amount of tightening seems to fix them., Exactly what I needed at an amazing price!, Fantastic Time Piece, Great Watch!  Bought it today at Target.for 25 bucks.well worth it perfect  size easy to use. I hope it hols up.but for the price great quality. I could  of saved a few bucks @amazon.com. But l tried it on I had to buy it . It should be a good workout  watch.and also waterproof  to 100meter and a 10 year battery., Able to use to replace battery in my Casio MTD1073  watch battery. However the chucks, they tend to slip., I'm really happy with this watchband.  I've been wearing a Luminox, supposedly Navy Seal, watch for 20 years and have gone through four or five rubber watchbands. Now, to have something different that's lighter, fits better, and will probably last longer is very satisfying., This is a good looking watch in silver with blue hands. It comes in a nice, sleeved gift box which includes a manual.<br />The watch is kinetically powered, and it started running as soon as it was placed on my wrist. It took a little while to figure<br />how to use all the buttons, (and to figure out what they were all for) and to set the time and date, but it wasn't difficult.<br />The closure clasp works easily, and doesn't pinch my skin like the last watch I owned.<br />I found the workmanship of this watch to be high, finishes are nice, and pieces fit together really well. The time stays accurate.<br />I do find the watch to be really huge and very heavy. I understand the current trend for oversized watches, but I prefer smaller, lighter watches, especially when there is the chance of catching the watch on various things at my work or knocking the clasp open. In my view the size is not very practical, but that is, of course, subjective, and dependent on how and where you use your arms., Awesome!, Good watch for the weekend. Dial is simple and clean., Bought as a gift, it was a gift, Not a bad beginner set, but the packaging was loose when I got it, and the watch opener is too wiggly to be of any use.  That's what I was really in this for, but it just won't open up anything that isn't already easy to open with fingers, and I've scratched a watch or two trying to use this., a touch of elegance. Clear dial face. supple band. Not gaudy. Just right., This fit my Timex Expedition perfectly.  My old, original band finally broke and I needed a generally cheap replacement.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I wear the Expedition outside while working on the lawn and getting mucky and dirty, and this band had stood up to that daily abuse., Handsome, weighty but comfortable., A+, I noticed it stopped about a week ago & just discovered that the return date ended 4 days ago so apparently there's no recourse.  Will not buy watch online from Amazon again.    [...], One of the prettiest Betty Boop watches I've ever purchased.  Just ordered another watch for my mom.  Would highly recommend this to all Betty Boop  fans., I always wanted to buy this watch and I'm so happy that I eventually did., There are actually a lot of things I like about the watch and a few I don't.  I like a day and date function which this has but the date window is very narrow and makes it a little harder to see for older eyes.  I really like the blue sunray dial, it is a striking color.  The strap isn't bad looking either and is a little stiff right now but I know from experience it will soften up.  The strap is relatively short and will only fit up to a 7 1/2 inch wrist.  The case size is a little smaller than I prefer now having fully embraced the large watch trend, although you can't really call it a trend anymore as many brands are making larger watches now.  The minute and hour hands are little thin and can be a little hard to see, they are a polished metal and the best way to see them is use the reflection from any light source.  The comical detail I referred to is the hour markers have luminescence on them but the minute and hour hands do not, which essentially means putting luminescence on the hour markers served no purpose because you would not be able to see where the minute and hour hands are at night.  This would be a decent starter watch for a young man and is recommended for those that intend it for that., I only wore the watch for a short time, shortly after getting it (around a month of wearing it ) it already showed wearing off of the multi colored band. Obviously the watch wasn't an actual Micheal Kors brand because my friend has the same watch she bought from the Michael Kors store in Destin, Fl. and hers shows no sign of the same wear. We both do the same job and wear them to work. I loved it until it showed these signs of being non-authentic when it was advertised as an actual name brand watch., Time slowly waned and backing fell off much of the time. Tossed in trash after six months., My son lost his other Timex at the beach. This was a replacement that became an upgrade. I love that I didn't need to use the instructions to set it up, it all showed up on the face., Purchased two of these for my twin sons, who have a problem with &#34;bedtime&#34;, and had previously used illuminated alarm clocks as improvised flashlights to stay up surreptitiously reading late into the night.  These fixed that issue, however, they also both broke within a few short months., Worked perfectly, the first time. I read a tip suggesting I pout a little oil or WD-40 on the link pin I wanted to remove. I did this a few days for I used this product. The pin came right out. Great purchase., This is a gorgeous watch.  No other words to describe it., Terrible product. I wasted my money on this it is cheap.You cant remove the links either., Keep it short and simple. This is a must have ABC watch. . If you got the extra dough, grab a Suunto. But the PAG240 does everything I need. I would have worn this thing down range.  Solid., Great little watch needed for school. Not to big and comfortable band does not pinch my skin. Very satisfied, best watch ever, Very big face! Lots of fun. Lots of information. Hard to remember how to use all of the functions, but I keep the manual handy. Not made with women in mind. Do not understand why manufacturers totally ignore women when creating these types of watches., Sweet watch perfect for all purpose watch! Green and black really pop! Hope the pics help this watch is by far my favorite!, I love the watch.  Size is right. The straps are gold quality leather.  Only thing I am not crazy is the weight of the watch itself, it feels fake., I give it two stars for a few reasons<br /><br />First off I am pretty sure I received a defective watch. My reasoning for saying this is because<br /><br />- the bar where the watch latches onto was bent out of place making it extremely difficult to get the watch onto my wrist, and even when I could get it onto my wrist it had trouble staying on.<br />- After a few hours of wear I noticed the watch had stopped telling time. I reset the watch but it will only work for half an hour or so before it just randomly stops. I figure it must just be the battery and it is easily replaceable but I really have to go out and purchase a battery for a brand new watch?<br /><br />I have never had any other problems with a Nixon watch in the past so I figure I must of just received a defective one.<br /><br />But other than that the watch is very nice looking and stylish. The black on black looks sick! But I am still extremely disappointed., Falling apart within weeks of purchase.  All watches have same generic innards, but for exterior to be this cheap, and not worth effort and cost of warranty that was supposed to be free, is really disappointing.  I should have gone with timex., This watch is great, the movement, the case, the band, it all comes together in an attractive and affordable package with a 5 year warranty to boot. I set it to the atomic clock 6 days ago and I am only 1.5 seconds ahead this morning. The craftsmanship and quality of this timepiece far exceeds the price. EcoDrive is an amazing technology.<br /><br />This is a must have every day watch for any collection., Looks really nice. Wrapped really well when I recieved it in the mail. Not as quiet as I would like it to be. But quiet enough. The plexiglass that covers the watches are kind of hard to open. You would need to place your fingernail on the crevice to flip it open. The controls are a little confusing to how to turn off the one you want to turn off, when trying to get one of the watch from the 4. It's still too early for me to rate the motor on this. Hope it will last. Not bad for the price., I wanted a B&R style watch without the price tag, and this is what I got. The band could be a little longer and softer (it's thick and stiff), but it is genuine leather where it counts. The case sounds hollow and thin compared to my Diesels but it's very light for its size. I was hoping the numbers and arms would glow, they don't, so this isn't night friendly. Overall I bought it for style and low cost and it suits the price tag., Thanks great watch and service! Perfect watch, affordable, simple,  durable, water resistant. Put it  on and never take it off for 2-3 years when the band breaks.Though this time the light  doesn't work but small detail since it's hard to find my favorite watch., While this Timex is a lower end watch, it meets the need of everyday wear when you Don't want to mess up a more expensive timepiece.<br />And, it keeps time accurately., Love the watch, but the battery was dead when I received it. Had to get a new battery on a new watch., Fits well and functions well., Came with NO INSTRUCTIONS. The picture on amazon shows a blue-ish white light on the watch however, the lights are only red and doesn't change colors. I should've paid more attention to the bad reviews., Fantastic idea but broke after 4 weeks., I bought this watch after being NAUI scuba certified and let me tell you this is my favorite watch ever. The high  Quality  that is put into this watch  really shows it features a screw down crown which can be a little bit difficult to get used to but all you have to do is unscrew the crown and it helps keep the water out whenever it's screwed in this watch is movement powered  using an amazing Japanese Patton and I would never ever ever write a review other than what I am writing due to the fact of the high-quality made by Swiss company that is meant to look just like the Rolex submariner .  Best dive watch I have ever owned would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a dive watch and is unsure five stars  also features one of the best glow in the dark features I have ever seen works just using the light and then it glows very highly so that you can easily see it in the movie theaters or in bed or underwater it that is dark . Comes in a very nice cheese box by Invicta is amazing, only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it didn't come with Manuel to explain how to set it. asides for that one nip pick its amazing so far and will be part of EDC., Great watch! In fact, I might need to order another watch because my 7 year old daughter keeps stealing it and wearing it!, One of the nicest synthetic bands I have ever had.  Easy to size.  Hard to find 22mm strap. Very comfortable., Very Cheap, Too big for my wrist. Wish they would have posted sizes so I would have realized size before I bought., Love this watch, it's tiny and comfortable and I've ordered it multiple times (after losing it). Pretty water-resistant too, Simple, functional and attractive. Plus this watch is an excellent value. I do wish that either a push button or fold over clasp was included, but overall I'm very satisfied with this watch., Simple design.<br />Light.<br />Awesome.<br />Sexy.<br />Buy it now.<br /><br />Reviewed by a Whale., This was a really pretty watch. However, the clasp did not work properly and for the cost of this item, I would have expected it to., Pefect, exactly what I wanted, This watch replaced a similar Timex that lasted many years.  I expect the same from this one.  I like the easy to read dial and nylon band., Bought this for a friend I owed a favor. Told him 20 years ago I would but him a batman watch if he stopped crying.lol, Slick feels expensive. Awesome for business and perception. Money well worth spend, baaaaaaaaaad, For the money nice watch very accurate to the second over the one week I have had it. Purchased it for a travel watch not wanting to take my expensive watch on the trip., Pins are made of the cheapest and softest metal there is.  I can't complain about the cost, but the metal used for the pins could be a little stronger.  One time use as pins not only bend, but break almost immediately., The first watch was damaged during shipment. Seller responded immediately to my email (complaint) and offered to send a new one. I love these watches and have one in nearly every color so,I was very disappointed when I received it. I expected to be told to kick rocks when I complained since I paid next to nothing for the watch to begin with. The second watch came within days and was packaged much better and now I have a cool lime green watch in my collection., This watch was a little larger than expected, but once hubby got used to it being larger than his other watches, he LOVES IT. He continues to get compliments on it and loves how a gold watch matches his wedding band. Very sophisticated and a good weight to it. It's easy to see the hands and we would recommend it!, I love this watch! It doesn't come stiff, and fits really well. I have a very small wrist and it fits mine. The shipping was fast and when I opened it I received the dw box as well. Favorite women's watch so far!, Worked really well.  I had to remove a few links from a newly purchased Invicta watch.  Sure, I could go out to the garage and find a nail set and some pliers, but I'd just spent over $100 on a watch and didn't want to scratch it up.  So, I bought this and it made life a lot easier.<br /><br />One critical note:  The piece that lets you set your watch band in it and screw the pin out is very flimsy.  Mine had two plastic pieces on either end that promptly fell right off and I had to glue them back on.  Without those pieces, the whole knob falls apart and can't be used for removing pins.  It was an easy fix, but annoying., It is another typical &#34;Junk Made in China!&#34;! Water gets in freely from front side and back side even when you sweat a little !, has lost time once already. Ok since., Fantastic costumer servise..thank you so much., Once again Nautica has a winner. Smart and stylish for the yachtsman. Real watch quality in the case design and the nautical flags are a real nice touch. This watch is a super buy!, Watch is as expected, very good one.. no problems at all Packing was very poor.. got the watch stand broken... either broken during shipping or it was broken when packed, Really cute! Makes a great gift for HK lovers., Great watch. Comes in an awesome case. Good idea for an anniversary gift. Every man will love one of these watches., Susenstone® Elegant Women Girl Watch Rhinestone Quartz OL Ladies Wrist Watch Red: I bought this originally for a friend, but wound up falling in love with it when opening it. It is elegant, arrived early, the gems are sparkly, the band seems durable, the color is the same as promised and it is easy to set the time on. I also enjoy how the numbers are Roman numerals instead of just plain numbers. I'm very happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., Purchased watch from Jewelry & Watch Exchange. Received watch around /or after April 24 2015.  Haven't worn it much so I did not notice until after 4 months later, the watch had stopped working (  No abuse to it).  Either the watch was old stock and the battery was already and was drained before it was shipped to meor the watch is of bad quality.  I do buy a couple of watches every year but I have never had a watch which last less than 6 years (with battery replacement every 2 or 3 years)..  This watch just died in less than 4 months!!!!  Not sure if it is the seller with old stock or just bad Geneva design. Disappointed that I wasted my money.  Choose a different brand or a different seller since the watch is not returnable after 1 month when I read the warranty on Amazon from non-Amazon sellers.  Very sad., Nice watch. It's much better than I expected and I'm very happy with it. I wear it almost everyday., I have the white one and have wanted to get a black one as well.Love the clean and simple lines of this watch.. Great value as well., Very disappointed in this very cute watch, which  is a really beautiful concept, but a total fail on execution.  I've had many Casio watches and another Baby G and loved them all. The photo for this product is completely misleading.  There is no way you can see the digital windows, although the photo makes it look like you can.  The back light does not light the digital windows.  If you're just looking for a very durable watch, sure, this will work fine.  Casios last forever and keep great time.  But, if like me, you actually need to use the stop watch or alarm functions, forget it.  I read the other reviews about the difficulty in seeing the digital windows, and thought they must be talking about the very minor contrast issues that I experience with my other Baby G.  No, I held the watch under a reading light and still could barely see the digital windows.  Completely unusable for me as an exercise physiologist who monitors exercise and recovery heart rates, and times exercise bouts.  Maybe even more outrageous than this design is the fact that I have to wait for the seller to &#34;approve&#34; my return.  Being that the product did not fit the website description,  you would think that's an automatic return.  Think again.  I gave it two stars because if you don't need to use any of the functions, it's a really cute watch, Batteries dead before wearing., This looks like a child-size version of my Fossil Cecile watch, so I bought it for my 3 year old daughter as a look-alike. I knew it could too big for her, but for the very low price, I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it arrived almost shrink wrapped around the latch and I struggled to get the plastic off of it. I must have broken the latch in the process, although it might have arrived that way. I decided not to bother returning it, but threw it away because the broken latch was unsafe., 1. Too thick for s dress watch 2. Not very accurate. 5 minutes gain already on my watch. 3. Inconvenient watch strap. The seagull rodina is a much better one, I have bought this style of watch four times.  The only downside is it's hard to remember how to reset it. Save your instructions, I scanned mine and saved on my computer.  I didn't really NEED this watch, I bought it for the instructions.  Now I can set all three of my watches correctly.  It's durable and water resistant, runs like a TIMEX!, Excelente!!!, I love Timex Weekender watches for the ability to switch watch bands to match just about anything. I own several in different face colors and sizes, and my favorite in both sizes is the grey face. I love that the second hand matches the color of the watch band that comes with it. I think I like the women's size best, but the selection of band colors is more limited. I wish both sizes had more colors in the bands and that they were more readily available., My husband has had 2 of these watches.  Both have quit working within 6 months.  It was guaranteed for 1 year but Timex has you send it back and enclose a $20 check  Not worth returning for the cost., Dial broke after return policy term expired., Does everything literature says it does. Setting instructions easy to follow from web download., A very handsome product. The only draw back is the weight. It's kinda heavy, Attractive and large enough I can read it, i will to buy again, My god poor quality this item, What a poor product!  The bezel fell off in the pool, not long after the colored fob on the dial disappeared (I know not where). 40Nine should put its money into a better product, rather than full page advertising in The New York Times., Cheaply made, disappointed., The dial is ok, it is a bit too dark to tell the difference sometimes., Cute and lightweight!, It's not A1 quality. In my opinion it is a B minus quality. It's wrist bend is toooo cheap looking. It's 'second' hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine. With the issues I metioned. it is not worth the price I paid. I am disappointed about the quality. I was expecting better than that. Will not buy from Sinobi again., The battary watch is speed did, I've worn Timex digital watches for at least 30 years now and have been a devotee of their Triathlon line, but lately I have been unimpressed with them as it seems their quality is slipping.  The last one I had has had issues ranging from the black trim that surrounds the display coming off to it occasionally resetting itself and the display going blank for no apparent reason.  I decided to try Casio instead this time and don't quite have the love for it that I had for the Timex watches of old.  I am liking the five different alarms that can be used, but wish that the chime was louder and lasted longer.  As far as how it is built, it seems fairly rugged and put together well, but time will be the deciding factor on this.  I like the solar charging feature and hope that it works as promised.  So far I've had no issues with that.  My main gripes about it is that I wish the display was bigger and the volume of the alarm.  There is a lot going on as far as display features and other trim pieces, including the photovoltaic cells that circle the display and reduce the usable space, but it seems that Casio could do a better job of reducing the clutter on the display and increasing the size of the digits.  But all this could be attributed to my pushing 60 also, as well as the volume objection.  I have a smaller wrist so went for this watch because of it's size relative to some of the other watches Casio makes.  That was one of the things I liked about the Triathlon watch from Timex, it's size as well as an easy to read display and as alarm that was plenty loud and long.  Last complaint is the light for the display, being the old side illuminating light.  Couple that with the smaller digits and it just isn't up to the readability of the Timex. After all this nit picking I have to say that I still like it though.  The band is more comfortable, the look is good and the functions work well.  Maybe in time after this one wears out I'll go for a different model that is larger tosee if the screen is more readable., it came broken, I didn't bother to send it back, thought It was a awesome item, very disappointed, I bought this watch because the mineral crystal was to resist scratches.  The crystal made the watch much thicker than the usual Casio sports chronograph and it proved less resistant to ? use than any, repeat any of my last 4 Casios.  Most of my Casio watches last 6 to 8 years and I go through multiple watch bands during their lifetime.  This watch lasted one year.  It still keeps perfect time but the crystal is so opaque I can't see the time in sunlight.  I have always loved my sports chronographs, never take them off, but this one was not in the ballpark of my others.  I'm 68 and arthritic so it's not like I'm incredibly hard on them either., Battery doesn't last., My go to watch. I love the look and how easy it is to use. However, setting the correct time and date was not easy. The online manual is not very helpful., This watch was very carefully packed and in a very nice box. The watch itself is beautiful and unique. 1. The wood is real and it is well polished.  The band is put  together very carefully and it is not scratchy. 3. The color combination and the contrast on the dial are very tastefully done. 4. The label of the company is clearly shown on the watch, however,  it fits with the design--not as an &#34;in your face logo.&#34; I don't like when the logo takes over the product. 5. The clasp is easy to open and to close. Push on the side buttons to open it or to close it on your hand. 6. The band is fairly wide and comfortable. The dial is very easy to read and no detail is out of place. It's a joy to look at the  watch, instead of the ubiquitous &#34;clock app&#34; on a smart phone. :=) I am very impressed with this company. I've always received clear and prompt responses to my questions; the few items I bought were always carefully packed and clearly inspected.  I hope that the company will continue its tradition in providing outstanding unique products and service. I found a few things for my wishlist already. :) I really enjoy wearing this watch., I'm disappointed with it's appearance of the coatings, and lack of any illumination of, the face or hands! I rashly threw away the box. Before I thoroughly inspected the product! So that's my fault!, Yes, the band on this thing sucks, cheap leather, I needed to replace a silver watch that I lost. This one was a bright and shiny silver watch that was attractive in its simplicity. When I received it, the face was a little larger than I wanted, but I quickly adjusted to it. The band was a little stiff, so it didn't move with my wrist as well as I would have liked, but I adjusted to that also. I only wore the watch about five or six times. One time the watch fell from my wrist onto the ground, and I assumed I had not properly snapped the clasp. I made sure the clasp was closed tightly and wore the watch the rest of the day without incident. Another time it fell off my wrist but landed in my lap. Again I think I did not snap the clasp hard enough. I vowed to always double check the clasp, but started to wish the watch had a protective chain, so it couldn't fall off my wrist. One day, I wanted to protect the watch from getting scratched while I was doing something,  so I removed it and put it into a QUILTED pouch in my purse all by itself.  When I later took it out to wear it, I found that the pin had fallen out so one side of the band had separated from the watch. Now this watch that I wore only a handful of times needs repair. And even if I spent the money to fix it, I fear the pin will fall out again. When I attempted to return it, I was informed it was too late to do so., I love the watch but thankfully I have big hands and wrists because the watch is a pretty big watch but it's a great watch, Wasn't  too thrilled, couldn't figure  how to set time. I followed instructions but was not successful. So nestles to say the kid isn't  using it. Have to figure  out another time., A birthday gift for my oldest daughter.  She has quite the Invicta collection, thanks to me.  This one is a little more traditional and girly.  She loves it and if she's happy then I'm happy., I really liked the design, but the time gets wrong if not used the watch for a long time.<br />I have many watches, and when I try to use this watch after leaving it one month,<br />The time is always not correct., Great quality as expected from Invicta. Unusual design and meticulously made., Disappointed that this watch does not have military time. It was a gift for our grandson who is in the,Army.  Otherwise, we're happy with it.  Great transaction., As a nursing student, this product is perfect for my needs.  It fits beautifully, and has the second hand that is necessary for taking vitals on my clinical patients. A digital watch would not work for my needs as I need the second hand. I love that it is stylish as well.  Cute colors in the face, while white to fit the requirements of my school uniform, Perfect for my 90-year old mom.  The numbers are easy for her to see., I bought this as a gift for someone who is really petite. The watch is REALLY heavy but you can tell it's crafted well. But had to send back cause it would have been too heavy and too big for the person. I didn't want to keep it cause I thought it would be too heavy for me. Maybe better for a man than a woman., It's not A1 quality. It's okay for the price., Didn't give this purchase enough forethought, and it is somewhat uncomfortable., I purchased the GA100-1a1 because I needed a nice rugged watch which was also stylish with good features. After reading reviews and checking out videos and pictures, I picked this one up. Im really happy with the purchase. It looks great with its sleek flat black band and black designed face. Comes in a nice gshock tin can that could be used for other purposes.<br /><br />The manual is easy to use with clear instructions and has various languages. The two digital areas on the left bottom and right bottom of the face can hold different information such as lap time, day/date, seconds, world time, &#34;home time&#34; and other various options. Its comfortable to wear and shock / water proof.<br /><br />There are a few things I personally wish were different. The hour and minute hand is not irridecent or illuminating at all. It appears as it should be. The illuminating face light is pretty dim and its a yellowish color. A bright white led would have been a better option. I kind of wish there was a second hand, but theres a digital seconds option for the bottom right digital area. Sometimes the hands can block it so its not visible. These are more-so personal options of what I would like, and not a flaw of the watch.<br /><br />Overall great watch for the price!, Seems to be a bit stiffer than the original band that came with my<br />SKX171 dive watch (not seikos best by any means) but is holding up<br />well.  No cracking or splitting so far., Excellent strap for the price, however, the pins that come with the strap are somewhat inferior. They kept popping off which lend me to replace the pins with stronger ones., I bought this to replace an extremely similar watch with a plastic strap that had died after years of constant use. This one doesn't need to be washed as often as the plastic, which smelled sweaty and weird every few months.<br /><br />I find it weirdly comforting to carry one electronic device that cannot malfunction due to programming or the Internet. Unlike some friends of mine with watches that cost hundreds of dollars, my watch always tells the time. It never says &#34;The device has stopped responding, please reboot&#34; or any other error message., It was a birthday gift for my son who is an executive . Suit, tie, and watches are his everyday attire. The packaging of the watch was classy and sturdy befitting the watch itself. The watch had weight and a high standard appearance. I would purchase another Stuhrling watch any day., Great watch, high quality. I can believe how little it cost for how amazing it is., A very beautiful watch. I carry it always, you need wind it each day but very handy if you need keep track of time. I tend to use up my cellphones battery often so this is a handy time piece., Been battle testing it offshore. No problems a little complicated so I need to read manual more. Over all very tough if you work in the offshore industry highly recommend as the alarm is actually a good strength. It is a big watch and so you will need to get used to this., Have had the watch about 3 years...watch still works great albeit a little scratched up...description claims mineral crystal display in one place and plastic in another, like to know which. Band has failed and it seems to make more sense to replace the watch than replace the band. I don't think the vast majority of owners ever run out of battery life., excelente, I bought this watch due some issues with other brands where water proof was not really water proof, this watch works perfectly., The watch face is gigantic and heavy.  It is definitely made for a man.  Have to return it because the huge size makes it very uncomfortable and unwieldy.  Hard to use a computer keyboard.  Too bad.  It looks really attractive in the photo, but the women's model is no smaller than the unisex., used to replace battery on water resistant watch - worked easily the 1st time used and highly recommended if you want to replace your own batteries, Nice watch, but I returned it because it is huge.  The pictures don't depict how big this watch is., 😍😍😍😍😍, I have only 3 negative comments. 1.  The manual is printed in almost unreadable tiny print.  2.  To use all of it's functions you would have to spend 2 hours reading the manual.  3. I worry that it won't get sufficient light to keep it charged.<br />Otherwise it works fine and looks good., This watch is very easy for children to read and the strap on it is easily adjusted. My daughter loves it., seems to be of good quality, purchased to have a spare on hand., I bought this watch mainly for the dial. I didn't really like the band so when I ordered I checked the width and ordered another one the same size. Imagine my surprise when I received both items when the band in fact is 22 mm, instead of the 23 stated in the specifications.  I would highly recommend being as accurate as possible when it comes to the information of the products you are selling, now I'm stuck with a watch that only like the dial, and bands with no watch to use with.  I'm not really happy, where's my money??!, Bought this for my daughter for christmas.  she loves Frozen, as all girls. She also loved that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  She also likes that she can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way she could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when she is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., Attractive but hard to read hands as they are the same color as the gearing. Needs to either be worn every day or put on a winder because it has no ability to go without movement for more than a day., Easy to see.<br /><br /> Also, red and blue lighted dial. Loud alarm., The band lasted maybe 7 months before it broke in two places.  I expect a lot more for something of this price and supposed quality.  I've gotten more from products of much lower cost., The outer ring with the numbers on it is made of really flimsy plastic. The watch face is made of plastic too. With an active kid it would probably be scratched in no time and the band is just a thin strip of fabric. I like the concept of the watch but the execution is poorly done., Not worth it .. it's just a dark screen protector it doesn't add any Privacy..  I took it off right away, For the money ($52.62), this is a delightful watch.  The size is right, the heft is right, the finishes are sophisticated and clean, it's comfortable; all in all, a great addition to the collection.  I removed five of the six links with pins and the fit, thanks to the micro adjustments on the clasp, is perfect (very easy to size at home).  The legibility in bright light is not bad.  Black hands on a black face is not the best combo, but the white luminous inserts on the hands help a bit.  I like the screw-down crown as well.<br /><br />Downside?  The numerals and markers are not luminous.  My bad for not reading thoroughly, but it makes the watch almost impossible to read in low light or darkness.  That's a feature I rely on in a workhorse watch, so this is relegated to occasional duty.  The other issue is the internal rotating bezel.  I love the feature, but it isn't locked or ratcheted, so it is easily displaced by normal movement, and, therefore, useless.<br /><br />I like it.  At that price I really like it.  But it's so close to being so much more!, Fast delivery good product, I bought this watch for my exercise purpose, since I am an outdoor exercise lover.  My dripping sweat could do nothing to this watch.  It is also attractive., Round design and plastic materials are ugly, squeaked, and broke after a year. Did the job for the time being but i am happy and not surprised i'm replacing it., Formy dad, Very attractive watch which people notice and comment positively about. I bought it to keep track time at home on my recent trip to Asia. Per Murphy's Law, of course, China, Taiwan and Singapore are currently all 12 hours from the East Coast so it was kind of superfluous. But still cool and there will be other time zones. I was not sure whether this was a wound or battery watch until I got it. Both movements are battery driven and seem to work well. Band is OK quality but in line with cost. Overall worth the price., Super cute bracelet but the straps are too long., My wrists are extremely small so I had to bore some additional holes for the band to fit.  In addition the face of the watch does seem a bit large on my small wrists, but that adds to the funkiness and unusual design of this watch., This watch is the biggest single piece of garbage ever produced. The chronograph quit funcioning about a month after I purchased this watch and they want $36.00 to repair a watch under warranty. Do not buy this!, Attractive watch.  Do wish it had more than one alarm., Got watch for my grandson. He is enjoying it., a, Functional and of fine quality.  Includes numerous tips suitable for opening everything.  A must have for checking movements prior to purchasing high end antique timepieces as well as for replacing batteries in the children's department store watches., I really don't understand.... I need more information how set time arlam ... It really didn't come with good instructions., I wanted a larger dial, but not a man's watch. I love the idea of the solar battery, and it is keeping perfect time. It is a terrific buy; just check Seiko's website., Watch is really well built. It fit fits and feels great. You can't beat the price for the quality., Couldn't be happier with it!  Color was exactly what I wanted., Wife loves it, therefore makes a hero out of me. Thank You Seiko and Amazon., Great little kit. Impossible to re-apply crystal to watch after installing new battery. Without it------impossible!, Other reviews of this watch face design mentioned difficulty behind able to actually read the hands as there wasn't enough contrast between them and the face.  This is not the case with this iteration, the hands are clear against the face and very easy to read even in low light.<br /><br />I have very thin wrists and was able to remove 5 links easily and the watch fits perfectly.<br /><br />The finish of the stainless steel is &#34;stained&#34; in appearance but has an almost soft powdery feel against the skin.<br /><br />I haven't tested out the 600ft underwater depth limit yet, nor do I plan to, but it's nice to know unlike everything these days, that getting it wet won't ruin it.<br /><br />Very pleased with my purchase., This watch is just awesome. I always loved swiss army watches and this one is no different. Perfectly sized snd feels heavy and sturdy. In all honesty it made me start a watch collection, I (female) bought this for myself because I like larger watches .I get a lot of compliments. Peoples attention goes right to my wrist and  it matches everything. I would give it 5 stars if the dial indicators & numbers glowed in  dark., I got this watch because I was looking for a vibration alarm that I could wear and it was one of the only ones I found.  All its features work well, but it is a LARGE watch.  I am a woman so my hands and wrists are smaller, but one of its side buttons has actually rubbed my skin raw a couple of times.  The manual is understandable and it's easy to set up the watch the way you want it., This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke, but I looked in the plastic bag the watch was in and found the pin that holds one end and after a little bit of effort it was back together. It also appear to not be running until I found a very small pices of plastic that was wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. The wife just loves it I also got her the Platinum one as well and had less trouble with it, as all I had to do was remove the little piece of plastic under the stem which holds the stem up so the battery is not drained during shipping. My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., Yup, worth for what you paid and more, Changing watch batteries is often frustrating due to the difficulty of getting the back of the watch into place. This device has solved the problem with a selection of dies for putting pressure on the watch & the back without risking shattering the crystal. It gives the necessary leverage for popping the back into place. Bravo!, Just what I wanted, Exactly what I needed and ordered! Love my Amazon experiences!!, Bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and Geeeeeez this watch is nice! It's very flashy and shiney.<br />It was packaged as brand new with the original Caisio box.  I hope he loves it because I sure do! And shipping was fast !, This watch is awesome!! The strap is very easy to adjust just need to cut, it has magnets to close the strap., This watch keeps moving, but loses accuracy within 5-10 minutes. Completely useless. It's fully wound, so it's not just stopping. It's about 8 minutes too slow for every hour, and I've had to adjust it too many times now. I can't trust it. Sending it back., My favorite watch  -  thanks for making women's  -  the men's were to huge for my wrist, Very nice watch for men or women.  Love the indigo for night time checks., Doesn't keep time we'll over any period of time. Must be reset regularly., I've got two comments on this review which describe a breakage I encountered shortly after receiving the watch. In case you don't read those comments, be aware that I did need a repair but that I was rough with the watch and the repair has held for some time now (and would be easy to repair again in the future.)  This is a very bulky watch. If you require a slim timepiece it is not for you. It is a very blingy watch, it will catch attention, if you don't want that all the time keep a more subtle piece for backup use.  This is THE best timepiece I have ever owned. I do joke sometimes that it is like wearing a wall clock on your wrist, but I am big and bulky so it suits me handily.  The most important feature for this for me was the chronograph. I use this everyday. I find it reliable, easy to read and use. Be aware, the hour dial tracks in half hour OR tenth of a second increments. After one half hour it begins tracking half hours. The minute hand tracks up to 30 minutes (this is when the half hour replaces tenths of a second on the hour dial). Don't be confused if you are under half an hour and the hour dial spins to a random number when pausing timing, this is the tenth of a second you are on. It (the hour dial hand) spins fast for the first 30 seconds then rests.  The only thing this is missing is a perpetual calendar. I feel like, with the bulk of the thing, it could probably include one, but I do have yet to find anything even remotely slimmer with retroactive day of the week, date of the month, and a chronograph that has even slightly decent ratings in this price range.  I wouldn't mind knowing exactly how much weight in gold the gold plating adds up to, and the &#34;crowns&#34; are &#34;gold-tone&#34; while the bezel and links are 18k gold plated.  Invicta Reserve pieces have absolutely proven to me that they are worth the investment!, Nice band replacement<br />Thanks, The straps are totally useless.First of all, they are very poor quality and they started deteriorating from the very first week.Second,they are not wide enough to fit the Santos XL chrono( as promised) leaving a gap in between .This was my first go with Amazon and I really feel cheated., Cool and easy to use watch, Poor quality, This is my fourth Invicta Russian Diver's Watch.  I'm very happy with it. These are very sporty watches and yes, they are big!  I won't be doing any deep sea diving , just the occasional swim and a lot of dish washing., Amazing product and seller!, recommended!, Came in with dead battery which had to be replaced before gifting..., You get what you pay for. It was real cheap so I figured I'd check it out to see if maybe it had any quality, but it's something you'd win out of a gumball machine., I read a lot of poor reviews for this and other products like it but I found it works great. It is quiet and keeps my Rolex running! I would definitely recommend this item., The watch wasn't able to sync the time ether on auto or manual mode. This was a deal breaker for me after all what good is to have an atomic watch if it doesn't work. I had to return it. I'm not sure if this is a common problem with this model but I have a ten year atomic Casio and it sync every night without problems., A, It's not A1 quality. I consider it B- quality. It's second hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine., Does the job done!, Thanks to this, I don't have to stop by a watch shop anymore. It is very easy to use., I have this model watch for a long time. I buy a new one every few years as mine gets beat up from wearing it to work everyday!! Amazon have the best price on this watch...., This was a GREAT watch. Did everything I expected it to do (keep time, of course) and more (it has a stopwatch feature and a night vision light). Sadly, the band broke, so I rigged to to continue to wear it, but it fell off of my wrist and is now forever lost. Definitely worth the price, wasn't worth the shipping time, though., Super cute, feminine watch. Dial is easy to read and the multiple colors of metal means I can wear it with silver or gold!, very googd, Love this watch. The face is definitely large. It is very stylish, comfortable. Very happy I made this purchase., Needed one of these for years., Every thing I expected.....my 1st experience with this watch maker. Praying i made a good choice!, i swim daily with it on. Able to see time @ night. It does its job as advertised. solid buy., I was really surprised at how great the quality was for such a low price. It is although, a lot larger than I expected which in turn resembles a more masculine watch. I would have preferred a more petite version. Still working on figuring out how to operate the many functions. The instructions could be better. Good quality watch., Pretty good watch for my Daughter, to heavy, as advertised, For the price it was a steal! However, slow shipping hence the 4 stars. I have big wrists and I'm using the 2nd button. If you have a small wrist this may not work. Very happy!!!, It was real nice watch for my husband gift., Got this watch for a trip to a certain city notorious for pickpockets and didn't want to risk my Tag. Love the clean basic style and did it job. The face is a bit on the small size for a man, but not too bad. Its biggest fault is the strap. It is far, far too short. I am 6'0&#34; and 180lbs, and the band barely fit my wrist and had to use the very last hole. So if your wrists run even moderately big, you may want to steer away from this., 100% recomendado, Horrible watch the bands broke while I tried it on the strap is peeling I only had it for a week had them check the diamonds that are real is like one small spec you can't even see these are those 5 dollar watches you get In downtown, This is a terrific slight improvement in a classic. I have been wearing them forever and every once in a while I need to replace.  Wanted one with a count down time for cooking a several models did not have.  When I searched for one with a count down time I got one listed at $150 and I could not figure out what it had otherwise that would justify more than $125 more than this watch.  Casio, please don't stop making this watch.  Thanks for improving the way data are shown on first screeni.  Time day date year all very easy to see., Awsome, it's a big and unique stylish watch from Columbia, the shipping was prompt. when I took the old band off and compared it too the new one I noticed the new one being a little smaller in overall size, ie., not as beefy as the original. also the buckle is chrome on the new one. original is black. I switched buckles. the new band does fit and I'm using it. the question is: has casio &#34;slimmed down&#34; their bands? or was a co_____f_it band shipped to me., Glass covering fell off after a year, It's just a waste and give a slight accidental blow and stops working.<br /><br />es un desperdicio apenas y le das un leve golpe accidental y deja de funcionar, Watch band completely broke off pin., Great watch, a bit tedious to set up, but once done it runs on its own. The watch is rather large, but you barely feel it on your hand. Highly recommended!, ike the watch, it is a real conversation starter!, The watch is excellent. After a month of use, it still operates, keeps accurate time, shines like new, and the face isn't scratched.<br /><br />This watch feels solid to the touch and it has a premium construction. It came in very nice packaging with a felt covered, hard watch case.<br /><br />My only issue are the link pins and the lack of instructions on how to remove them. I've owned 40+ watches and have adjusted the size of the band on nearly every one. I do it so often that I purchased a highly rated jewelers tool kit specifically for removing link pins and resizing watch bands. The Alexander watch uses a pin that I've never seen before. Not only were there not instructions in the user manual, you can't find anything on the Internet (I tried Google, Facebook, YouTube, jewelers forums, etc). I'm extremely tech savvy and I couldn't even find a hint. Even when looking up &#34;every type of watch pin and how to remove it&#34;, there was no mention of this type. To make it even more deceiving, there are etched arrows on the inside of the band which is supposed to always indicate that it's a push pin and that's the direction you remove it. After hours of trying and searching the Internet, I had to visit 3 jewelers before one figured it out. There are flat head screw holes on both sides. That's typically cosmetic, but not in this case. In order to remove the pin, you need 2 people and 2 tiny screwdrivers. One person has to hold one side of the pin still while the other person screws the other end out like you would a screw and bolt setup.<br /><br />I'm not sure how there are not explicit instructions somewhere to explain these unusual pins. I had the watch for a week before I wore it due to this. I'd have to imagine some less patient people returning this watch out of frustration. That is the only negative and I would've rated 5 stars if instructions were able to be found., Time will tell., Invicta makes very stylish watches, I buy them to give as gifts when I travel overseas to family, and everyone appreciates receiving them., I have been using this pocket watch with watch attached to a leather key fob. The fob allows the watch to be protected by any coins or keys I may have next to it in my pocket.<br />This watch, within about 2 weeks had most of the finish rubbed off of the metal back plate. The plastic crystal is also easily scratched or marred just by walking around with it in my pocket throughout the day.<br />By the way, I only take this Gotham with me 2-3 times a week, so it sees only light to medium wear and tear.<br />Yes, the watch keeps good time and the thin size is a good feature. I have another pocket watch that I bought for about $14.00 at a well known discount superstore and it has held up much better over a longer period of time than the Gotham. Save yourself some money and shop around, unless you have to have an extra thin pocket watch., These watches are large .However they say water resistant,THEY ARE NOT!!I wore in the shower and it actually filled up with water.I have cheap watches I wear to do yard work and in the shower that hold up better than these do.So as a novelty I guess there okay but I wouldn't buy again or wear doing dishes or in the shower.I didn't want something I have to remove when I'm near water., very happy, The clip that holds the little door shut wears out on these after a little while.  Had to super-glue it shut.  Luckily, you can still tell the time.  This occurred with several of the different styles I purchased for my partner., Very nice, better than I thought, but read the instructions before you try to set the date!, My son is absolutely in love with this watch. It is very good quality and allows the links to come out to fit a smaller wrist, Very cute!!  My g'son loved it even though he can't tell time!!, Extremely disappointed with this strap. I purchased this strap at the same time as one from another company. The other strap arrived in less than a week. This strap took 3. On top of that, the quality was horrible. The strap is very thin and the rings feel very flimsy.. Stay away from this strap., this was a gift for my cousin, Son Loves this watch.  Light weight, classy, dressy. just what my 18 yr old son was looking for.  He would purchase again., 100% recomendado\n",

Perfect for everyday wearing and goes with any attire!!! Very satisfied., I bought this as a replacement band for a Pebble Time and it works beautifully. It's a perfect match for the watch color and functions exactly as specified. The only minor drawback is with sizing: it's virtually impossible for anyone without the dexterity of an octopus to grasp two tiny screwdrivers and exert enough force to be able to unfasten the links. I ended up using a Swiss army knife blade to prevent one screw from turning and then unscrewing the other with a watchmaker's screwdriver., Delicate and fashion, if the table shows the second hand,then it is perfect., Really beautiful watch.

            "It works well on me. However, I found cheaper prices in other places after making the purchase, Works great but the watch a used it on was slim so I had to use a quarter to rase it up the right height, It works well with nice simple look., Perfect Condition, Arrived on Time,Works & Looks Great, So far so good. I have only had this watch a few weeks & so far it is still working. Style is really cute exactly as pictured, This press is very well constructed and sturdy. The different dies are easily interchangeable. A good tool for watches and miniature work., Loved the watch; it just did not work supposedly self-winding; tried all possible motions to cause the winder clearly visible from the rear of the watch; no luck, Love the Watch. Good Deal and works Good.. :-), works good so far., Stopped working after one week. Have no idea why. Will try to return or exchange., So the watch stopped working almost as soon as I got it but it's so cute that sometimes I'll just wear it as a fashion accessory.  Not very practical but all in all a good buy., Garbage product that should be sold in a plastic egg in a quarter operated vending machine. I'd give it 1 star but I accidentally got it to work before it fell apart., work for a week dont broke, Good looking and smart! Works like a charm., Good for work, Great key. Works well and does exactly as it should. Solid Construction., it 's good watch . I wear when I work. it light and look style.thanks, I wasn't able to get this to work. At all. So it's sitting in a box somewhere., Loving it.  Works fine, easy to set up, etc.  I used to have one of these when I was a kid, so it's the nostalgia that's really got me going., not a bad watch but don't use it on water or else the it will stop working, Works, Worked great. Hope to get another 10 years from my Casio G-shock watch., Returned it as it did not work!, it is beautiful and it works just fine, No instructions, couldn't get it to work.  Useless, Everything you want in a $16.00 watch and more!<br /><br />No, really a useful, serviceable timepiece. Works great., This does not work with the IPhones, Works will with my watch.Thanks, Shipping?... Less than two days!<br />This watch is really nice. Reminds me<br />of a Panerai Daylight.<br />Works fine, I'm happy with it.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, Bad Quality in this moment no working, The product is good when it works.  Within months of purchasing this, one side of the winder stopped working.  The seller sent a part that we replaced ourselves and it seemed to get it to work...for a little while.  Few months later, both sides of the winder stopped working.  Product works less than a year.  Contacted seller and was told no warranty.  So unless you are good with paying for something that last less than a year...would not recommend buying this., i wear it often.  works well, Very cheaply made. Battery doesn't even work, Extremely Poor Quality product!<br /><br />I received one and thought all was fine.  A few hours later, it had stopped.  I tried to reset it and both hands moved together.  I pushed the stem back in and the second hand tries to go backwards occasionally and the other hands don't move!<br /><br />I contacted JewlreyWe asking for a replacement.  By the end of the week, I had the replacement.  That one is even worse!  From the get-go, it would not set.  I pull the stem to set it and the hands don't move.  I push the stem back in and the hands now spin around the center loosely as I shift the watch.<br /><br />I contacted again, this time asking for a refund.  Instead, they're sending me a 3rd one!  Will this one be any better?  Two absolutely total wastes as a watch -- what are the chances?<br /><br />At this point, I have two little velvet bags, two nice chains, two batteries, and two little owl-shaped paperweights!  They said I didn't have to send them back.  Note -- the little velvet bags do NOT have &#34;JewelryWe&#34; printed on them.  The description is wrong there.<br /><br />Update (9/12/15) -- I did get the third one and despite JewelreWe saying they ship from MA, it shipped from China.  However, it did finally work!  It has a visible flaw in that it looks like the owl is crying!  I have corrected the problem because of the two previous non-working owls.  I removed the big screw in the back from this and one of the other owls and swapped the eyes!  Again -- more work on my part but I finally -- after over 3 weeks  - got a working and pretty owl pendant watch., I love this design was so excited to receive it , but when I got it it didn't work. I returned it very disappointed., Works great!, It's hard to set it and the buttons no longer work on it after a week, Watch works very well., Its OK.  The fit is good and worked well for a few months.  Now the light no longer works and the entire watch resets occasionally when the mode button is pressed., Works like a charm., Great watch, nice deal, works perfectly...exactly what i needed. Recommended., Great product, quiet and it works, Watch works as described. I only wish the dial used luminous paint for the numbers and hands. I like the watch alot., Works great only thing missing is the ability to give the date., too bad a little time after no working more, Bad quality. Stop working within a week after I got it., Works great. Stylish.  Looking to buy other colors too. Thanks. MauistyleAloha.com, Sk8Maui.com TexasStyleSkateboarding.com, They work like they should., it doesn't work, dissapointed, Works as expected but very loud clicking noise., Nice watch. Works great so far but losses a little time., This watch stopped working in about 5 weeks., I received my watch in a very timely matter and it was packaged better than my previous G-Shock from the store. I love every aspect of this watch. It's great for my job and stylish enough to wear outside of work., That's too bottons not working. Only accesoris?, Stopped working about 24 hrs after I got it. Dead battery., I have to admit that iI wasn't quite sure I was actually going to get it first of all and that if I did if it was going to work well.<br />I'm  saying this because it was  ridiculous low price for the look that this product can give. surprisingly enough this watch works fine. except for the 24 hr  and montly indicators. they are stationary.  i though the metal part wast going to rust and change color, so far it hasn't .<br />good product for that price., This is a very nice watch. I like to use it when I am working in the garden and in the kitchen. I don't have to worry about having to take it off for dirty work., These have worked nicely so far., Very disappointed with this watch, does not work.  I removed the pin and set the time and the hands never moved., Works well, My watch stopped working almost right away! Gumball machine quality., this watch so far has been really nice. it fits comfortably, not big and bulky, easy to use perfect for work, Have used it several times.  Works great!, It stoped working 3 days after arriving..., works well, it is a bit difficult to program without the manual., Works great on my Tag H watch, After a while (several weeks only) the water vapor starts condensing inside the watch. The watch stops working. Beautiful, but cheap and defective watch. Do not buy it ever!, Works as expected, I could not get it to work.  The battery would not charge.  Returned it., It is to heavy I used couple times and today I wanted to use did NOT Work. Was  a BAD investment  Was a Christmas gift from my wife I keeper I a nice yellow box. And does Not work, stopped working on batteries after a few  months, Good. Bought it as a gift and passed it on, so cannot comment on its working., This watch survived me having to lay down my bike.  The pavement sanded off a good portion of the G shock raised portion, which would've been the flesh on my wrist if I wasn't wearing it.  And it still works., Stopped working after a week!, Prefect casual watch. Band a little thinner than it looks but works for what I needed., I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch band to be very well made, comfortable, and easy to adjust. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced, although it does not have a titanium bracelet.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., Works, Everything works fine now and looks great! It took about 8 hours under my desk lamp to fully charge it but keeps perfect time! Friends at work keep asking where I bought it? I send them to Amazon, Great value! My son needed this for work and it was fast to arrive, worked great, and held up under tough outdoor conditions., Is not working now. Is not the battery cause  I changed it., Works great and I have had compliments on the looks of the watch., I was excited to receive this watch. After initial struggles to get Android Wear to recognize this watch, it worked well for two days. Then mysteriously it stopped showing notifications and stopped vibrating. No amount of factory reset and unpairing and re-pairing helped. Finally I returned it. I will wait for a better watch to come along., NEVER WORKED! Hassled trying to return it. WASTED MY MONEY!, Soooooo cute and works great nice price, Night Back light stopped working after 2 months.<br /><br />I didn't pursue warranty due to low cost.<br /><br />I'm tired of buying this SH!t!!!!!!!!!, Works great! I love it. Easy to use., Definitely a cheapo version, but it will work., Husband wears this everyday to work. Loves it., Love this watch.  Bought one of these back in '79.  Still working today.  Have over 3000 dives with it.  Started losing a little time lately so decided to buy another., Very cheap, one didn't even work when I received them., Very cool watch that works incredibly well., I gave it as a gift and just got a call that the battery doesn't work, so I'll be sending it back. Although she liked the watch I'm hesitant to order it again., The price is right. It was a smaller face than expected but works fine., Looks good still working, This watch is a nice watch if you want one to beat up. It ticks fine and has the nice Indiglo back light. The proble that this watch has is that it is very easily scratches. I have a gouge on the face of mine that looks like someone dragged a drill across the face. Not sure how it got that way, but I only ever wear it to work (at a bakery). That being said, I have had two of these. The first one I had, the crown fell off. Again, no clue how, just looked at it and it was gone. I was given a replacement by Amazon, but that did not change the quality of the watch. If you're looking for something that looks good and is not over priced, this is a good watch, just don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Update: This is the last timex watch I will ever buy for more than $30. I used this watch for work and it could not hold up to my working conditions. I work at a gun range and also a bakery. Within one week of working the crystal sported a great gouge in and made it annoying to look at. This watch was also marred by smaller scratches from everyday use which made it look like someone had taken sandpaper to it. I quit wearing it regularly and made it a strictly work only watch. However after two weeks the watch met its end. The &#34;crystal&#34; had shattered and the watch was unreadable, ceasing to function. I didnt notice until I got home at the end of the night that it was in this condition. I didnt remember hitting my wrist hard on anything as I usually do if I smack my watch up against something, fearing that I may have damaged or broken it. But in this case I didnt notice or the actual hit which was the death blow must not have been that hard. The bottom line though is that this watch could not stand up to a couple weeks of normal wear and tear at work. I might pay $20 for this watch again, but certainly not the current (4/18/17) asking price of over $100. This watch has been broken for close to a year now, Im just now reminded of how much of a disappointment it was., Watch did not work!, Keeps Time. The buttons on either side don't work.  It's worth the $15., The watch was not on working condition when I received it and needed a new battery., Simple and sturdy. A great first alarm clock. No bells and whistles, but it works well, and it is loud!, The watch arrived very soon but didn't work at all.  None of the buttons would work and the illumination wouldn't come on.  It was stuck on an alarm setting and power saving mode and wouldn't let me change screens.  Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement because it is a very nice looking watch.  Hopefully the next one works.  Something that I did notice about it though was that the Casio box that it came in was taped up a lot with scotch tape like it had been dropped or damaged in some way., Easy to read and use. Need it for work. Work graveyard, DOES NOT WORK! Adjustment pins will not stay in the tool when turned upside down to apply to the watch...so therefore TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, Well the watch is cute and it works however the battery has a leak and left a chemical burn on my wrist., The watch works, but the band is uncomfortable., Very easy to wear. Been to the beach still working, Had an older model for years, the band gave out before the watch(still my outdoor work watch) love the upgrades and the efficiency of the solar ring. No better watch for my needs, Nice but worked exately for 10 months... and now i cannot return it<br />I do not recommend this, Battery is not working when I got it. I had to return it and Amazon sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, after several weeks the battery died again., broke within the first 2 min. Still works ok and I was able to do the job but some of the parts are really poor quality., I saw this watch in a Michael Kors store and loved it, not the price! I got home from vacation and searched online and was excited it was more affordable!! The watch is beautiful and works great so far., It looks nice, just like the pictures, but none of the three smaller dials works.  The minute, hour, and second hands all work which is all I need, so I'll keep it, but I can't give it more stars because it doesn't work how it says it should., It works and looks good. Thanks., I loved the look of the watch. It was exactly what I had been searching for for quite some time. The speed of delivery was fast so no complaints there. And the return to Amazon was so fast and efficient it left my head spinning, what a professional outfit.<br /><br />All that being said, I was SO VERY DISAPPOINTED in this watch. It is the first watch in my life (over 65) that when I went to set the time the stem pulled completely out of the watch!  Talk about being shocked! I stuck the stem back into the watch but of course nothing worked. I was heartbroken. I was tempted to make this a one star rating but I don't hate the watch and I still wish it had worked but to be honest I am now gun shy about buying another. And that saddens me,, Arrived on time and works as promised. Note that it mostly works at night rather than during the day so do not be surprised at the lack of activity during the day. It does not want to over-wind the watches., I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch's bracelet to be very well made, comfortable, easy to adjust, but a little bit heavy. Citizen sells this watch with a lighter titanium bracelet: [[ASIN:B001QFYKTA Citizen Men's JY0050-55L Blue Angels Skyhawk A-T Titanium Eco-Drive Watch]]. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]].

I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., only one worked, After having to send back the first one, because one of the two motors involved in rotating the watches was not working, the second version seems to be working properly. I love the fact that I can store up to 16 watches in this case and that it can run on electrical current or batteries., Cool looking pocket watch, works great, The watch I receive don't work very bad watch !!!!!!!!!!,, Product was defective. Stopped working after 2 weeks., Easy to use. Works on Jewelry and glasses that have never been cleaned., Work horse of a watch. From hiking to work to just walking this watch has the ability to do it. At one point it fell in water and was completely fine.\n",

            "Beautiful watch face.  The band looks nice all around.  The links do make that squeaky cheapo noise when you swing it back and forth on your wrist which can be embarrassing in front of watch enthusiasts.  However, to the naked eye from afar, you can't tell the links are cheap or folded because it is well polished and brushed and the folds are pretty tight for the most part.<br /><br />I love the new member of my collection and it looks great.  I've had it for about a week and so far it has kept good time despite day 1 which is typical of a new mechanical watch, The watch was pretty much as it was described and how it looks. I really like the simplicity of it and it looks pretty amazing. It is slightly too big, so I have yet to adjust it, but I'm glad it's too big rather than too small. The weight is good which is what I was hoping for. Very satisfied with this purchase. I was slightly on the fence getting this one because of the previous fossil watch I had, which by some time, did have some gems fall off from ring around the numbers, but so far so good with this one! Excuse my bad lighting for my pic., It is a cheap watch that looks cheap.  There isn't much else to say., This one is different from the rest of my Invictas. I like the big watches but this one gave a classy more defined look for the craftsmanship. All of the colors compliment each other. It all starts from the stitching of the band.  Very nice watch., Looks great and love to wear this watch.  Only negative thing is due to its blue/black colors, it is difficult to read in average or low light.  Good thing for me, I wear a watch for looks and not really for telling the time., Absolutely LOVE this watch! Amazon prime saved me over $400 after tax from the store prices. Between the great buy and the Coolness of this watch it was an amazing purchase. I can't stop looking at it. Movado is an excellent brand. Time keeping is perfect. Quality is perfect., This was a watch I bought during a quick sale thing, so it was cheaper than normal.  I bought it as a daily wear.  It's really a decent watch for the price; a retro look with a modern movement., I was very apprehensive about buying a 28 dollar watch online, but it looked so much like the 400 dollar Invicta Coalition forces watch I was wanting that I went for it.  I was very pleased when it arrived.  It is a BIG, heavy, sharp looking watch and I could not be happier. I am sure I will be purchasing the solid black one as well, Watch looks amazing and the features are second to none, but....the watch is small.  I have a PAW-5000 which dwarfs it.  I had to look at the box to make sure I didn't get a woman's watch.  No joke, the band on my, average at best, sized wrist almost couldn't accommodate it.  Probably had 1.5 inch left on the band after I put it on.  Make this Man-size and it would fantastic., Comfortable, looks great, very lightweight.The band is a little on the short side, but it's usable and not a big deal to replace., Love the look but the leather band is so stiff it doesn't conform well to my wrist., Watch kicks ass. Upon putting on this watch you will grow a full beard and be able to tame a pack of wolves by looking at them. 8/10 Only gripe is that I wish the back light was a tad better., I thought it looked beautiful.  My boyfriend loved it.  It's only been a few days, so I can't comment on durability.  But, I didn't have some of the problems mentioned in other reviews--the little dots around the outside glowed like they were supposed to, it was easy to set including the date, the band was fine and long enough even though my boyfriend wears it loose.  Great price too--I see them in stores for nearly twice what I paid., This is exactly what I was looking for!  I fixed my watch band and haven't been happier!  I didn't need 5, but the extra 4 may come in handy., A great automatic, but I give it 4 stars for being too conservative with its small size and the blue is dark and more of a navy color unless light is shining on it and reflecting. Other than that, like all based seiko 5s, it looks great on a Nato strap. I have this bad boy setup on a brown leather strap with a deployable clasp which looks very similar to the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra. A great watch that can be worn in almost any occasion except when swimming, This is a good looking men's watch that would go well with most outfits, though it's leather strap pushes it to a more dressy watch. It's a simple watch with a day and date window. It is luminescent on the hour marks but not on the watch hands themselves, which is a little weird.<br /><br />I would be curious to see how long the battery lasts. Aside from the watch band wearing out, that would be the weakest part of this watch in the long term., It's a great looking product. One of the best watches I have ever seen. The quality is mediocre but that's alright. Just keep it out of water as much as possible and the leather should hold up alright., Don't buy this watch.  It looked fine when it arrived, but back of watch has already begun to corrode.  The wrist band turns my wrist green., the dial looks so big compare to this iamge, I bought one of these watches in blue and although it is big that is the trend right now.  It is definitely not cheap looking as the previous reviewer stated.  It is a gorgeous watch with beautiful colors.  I am not sure what she was looking for but I completely disagree with her review., It was a gift, I happen to like watches especially with many dials (which I will never figure out) I hope the receipiant may have that ability.<br />The Band is cool looking, so the dial and the band were meant for each other.A truly good looking time piece and well made by a company who has been doing this for many years.If you haven't guessed that name as yet I will now tell you,  &#34;TIMEX&#34;, the price is right, get yourself one., You get what you paid for. The watch is so thick that it does not look nice as it is shown in the picture.<br />It reminds of $9.99 no name brand watches at Walmart. The band's design is not practical., I've had this blue Chicane for about 3 years now and own another 2 Orients and they are still some of my favorite pieces.<br /><br />The Chicane is the watch I wear most often. It works well in both casual and more formal dress situations, the blue face looks fantastic, the movement is high quality and the price is pretty much unbeatable. You really do get a lot of watch for your money. You can usually find Orient watches discounted throughout the web, so if you pay more than $150 for this watch, you've probably overpaid. That said, I'd stress again that the low price doesn't mean low quality. The watch is accurate and, despite the fact that I wear it everywhere and in all sorts of situations, the face has yet to scratch.<br /><br />The only negative in my opinion, is the folded-steel links in the band. They can pull the little hairs on your wrist occasionally. So a higher quality band might be something to look in to, although, despite the occasional pull, I've stuck with the OEM band for these 3 years and felt fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great looking and high-quality watch that, like all Orients, is a phenomenal deal. Highly recommended., Bought 7 of of these as gifts for my groomsmen and they all loved it.  The watches arrived within 3 days!  Watch looks great.  For the price and quality it was a great deal.  The size is good not too big for a square face watch.  Read the instructions on how to set the watch as because it can be tricky.  The subdials are quite small but still readable, and for a watch under 40$ with day and date dials still worth the money.  2 watches did arrive with dead batteries, but upon contacting amazon, they refunded me a fair amount to purchase and install batteries on my own., Love the looks,quality  n sizes of watch. Unfortunately I could not get it working properly. After 3 days trying , send it back. I am sure it was me running out of patients., It's a beautiful watch that I absolutely love, but it is running 3-4 minutes per month too fast.  It is expensive to fix.  I haven't yet looked into the warranty from Amazon, but it was a gift from my wife on our wedding I don't want to send it somewhere to have it adjusted.  I am just living with it for now., We looked at many clocks before coming across this one.  It looks very nice runs very smoothly/quietly.  We are very satisfied with this product., Looks awesome., All I can say is this is an amazing watch. It's nice and heavy and looks and feels so expensive! I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it!, I love this watch. It looks professional and stylish without being ostentatious, and actually looks awesome with my glitzy but delicate engagement ring, adding a hint of classic menswear. It's sturdy and you really can't beat the price, plus I have relatively narrow arms/wrists and the size is perfect. It has a really nice weight to it and everyone always thinks it's much more expensive than it really is., Bought it for my girlfriend, she loves it. She works in the health bussines so she needed something easy to clean, that could get wet and that matches her uniform. Great watch and theStar Series on the dial gives the watch a nice look., love the look just too big for my wrist., Soft, durable, comfortable band, and the face looks exactly as it does here. Reduces glare and the light up feature is great., I absolutely love the design and the quality of the watch materials. When I received the watch, it was set correctly so I did not have to make any adjustments to the date or day for almost 2 months after my purchase. Sadly, when I went to adjust the date because it was off from having a shorter month, I found out this part of the watch was broken. I do not wear it often and am not rough on it (primarily worn in an office setting). The band and watch face still look close to new, so I'm assuming the dial was broken when I received it and I realized it too late to return it. This is the third time this has happened to me when ordering a watch through Amazon. I absolutely love Kate Spade designs and they are generally of a superior quality, but when ordering on Amazon, you typically get a product that looks or functions like an item that was rejected by the maker because of minor dysfunctions. The gold-on-gold color make the watch slightly harder to read and the date dial is quite small, but the pink hands really help with visibility. The leather on this strap is very thick, which takes some adjusting to if you are used to wearing lower-profile watches. It is also a light enough color that if you are wearing it to work and are rubbing up against printed materials, the band will get a slight discoloration from the ink. The watch face is large, as other reviews suggest. I have a medium sized wrist (~ 16 cm), but it does not look too large on my wrist. When wearing it, I can definitely feel that I have a watch on, but the size makes it look like a nice statement piece., Love it ! ; got it for my lil brother & it looked just like the picture & didn't look or feel cheap. Only bad thing is I got it to help him tell time however the numbers are extremely small, This is a nice sports watch.  Bigger than it looks on the picture, so it want disappoint if that's one of the desires in getting it., The Swiss Legend World Timer is a nice higher end quartz movement watch with dressy looks and nice functionality.  The watch is BIG coming in at 48.5 mm case diameter so this is basically a large man's watch.  I would say it wears small-average for it's size but again it's a big watch.<br /><br />It does have gold accents on it but it doesn't come off gaudy at all.  Overall I highly recommend this if you are looking for a large men's quartz watch for dress occasions., This watch looks good and real leather band but when you take it out of the package it feels cheap, lightweight, and you begin to notice the lack of beefiness, and masculinity points dropped. It lacks weight, but it would be good for someone that needs a watch that is light weight, has visual appeal, and isn't concerned about it getting chewed up or broken., Bought this as a gift for my grandfather, its beautiful and looks just as nice and high quality as the more expensive ones! He loved it, great gift for men, who can be so hard to shop for. It's something they wouldn't buy for themselves but can still appreciate and use!, This is a gorgeous watch. I almost canceled my order because I was scared it might look to masculine for my female wrist. Im glad I didn't. The combination of colors with the grey polished metal face, stainless steal bezel and black croc band gives it a nice rich look. I have an average female wrist and it fits fine. What doesn't show on the pic or video is the number markers are indented into the metal which plays beautifully in the light. Its a steal for the price and works for a man or a woman., Its really nice and it looks good to me. Thumbs up!, Love the look and function as advertised. Couldn't beat the price., I was looking for a watch with a brown strap that had a somewhat timeless look.  I almost went for a chronograph just because I love the way they look but for the price on this watch I couldn't pass it up.  This is a nice addition to my very small collection and it's my first automatic.  I only wear it once or twice a week but setting the time and date only takes 30 seconds so it's not a big deal.  I first thought the inscription on the band was cheesy but the more I thought about the words &#34;without liberty life is a misery&#34; the more I wanted the watch.  The inscription adds a little flair to an otherwise simple yet sophisticated watch.  The band has variations in the brown color so this watch can be paired with light brown shoes/belt as well as dark burgundy / oxblood shoes/belt.  It fits well and looks great., the band looks good but it was a bear getting the links out to resize it without the holder to keep the band aligned while removing the extra links., I recently went shopping for a new watch when my old Timex band started cracking after 8 years. Duct tape works ok to keep it together but I needed something that looks good on my wrist.<br /><br />I went to Target looking for a new band and I decided that for a few dollars more I could just buy a new watch and use the old one for yard work and working out.<br /><br />This model met all my requirements. I wanted a clean easy-to-read design with date and day, a comfortable brown leather band and a face that lights up clearly in the dark. So far after a few weeks I have been very happy. It looks as good as my $150 Seiko at a fraction of the price as well as keeps good time. It's still accurate to the second since I first set it.<br /><br />I am a medium to large man who normally can only get the last notch buckled in most watch bands. This band will buckle to the second notch. The advantage of leather is that it CAN stretch, so don't worry if you have large wrists. A few minutes soaking the band in water will let it custom fit even the largest of wrists.<br /><br />Design wise this watch has a nice clean legible design. I'm not going SCUBA diving or orienteering in the woods. I just want a nice stylish watch that will tell the time accurately at a glance without the distraction of nonsensical mini dials. The smaller case still looks good on my larger than normal wrist and doesn't catch on doorways or sleeves like a large bulky case would.<br /><br />I've always had good luck with Timex watches since I was a kid. Good quality for the money. The only reason I have an expensive Seiko was because it was a gift and I only wear it for formal occasions.<br /><br />Like the old ad says, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking..., I like the watch it looks nice and fits comfortably on my wrist. But I was looking the watch over and noticed that it is advertised as being Swiss quartz movement and the watch I received is a Japan movement. This concerns me some as I am not sure what exactly this means as far as why mine is different than the one advertised., cool watch, slim and big dial. Looks great, Looks great, came super fast. I would recommend., It looks good and in the rose gold it is definitely an eye catcher!! Enjoy wearing it too. It looks great with my MK rose gold metallic Cindy large satchel handbag I also purchased on Amazon Prime a few months back. I'm a Prime shopper for sure!, A very solid, good looking watch. It was given as a gift and was loved by the recipient. The Mother of Pearl face makes this watch stand out above others. So far it has kept perfect time. The solar feature is great. No more batteries to replace., so far so good,  it is a good looking watch.  With all the necessary features one needs.  only drawback is the date window, the date is awfully small., Just whatI was looking for, This is a beautiful watch.  I have worn other watches by Kenneth Cole for years.  This is just as nice of quality as previous styles.  The rose color is softer than some other brands and looks more delicate and professional.  The numerals on the face are Roman and that also adds character to the watch., Bought this for my husband for our 7th anniversary. It really is a cool looking, trendy watch that fits his style very well., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, Watch looks great and was easy to use.  My wife loves it, Great watch for everyday use!  It is big enough to see the time even without putting the watch directly in front of your face... so if you need a watch that you can look at subtly (if you're on a bad date), this is the watch to get! : ), The strap itself is pretty great but it didn't come with the springs to put it on my watch (which every strap I've ordered online thus far HAS included) so I was kinda bummed about that.. It unfortunately doesn't look really good with my original white Pebble watch so I won't be using it after all - but it's a good strap if you have a conventional watch to re-strap!, If looking for a FUN / Practical & good quality watch for the Spring / Summer, this is the one to grab!!!  I definitely am enjoying mine this Summer '15., It looks even better in person than it does in the picture. Awesome watch, I love Nixon., Love it, looks just like the picture. Actually a lot nicer in real life because of the mother of pearl casing and the grey leather and rose-gold contrast.<br /><br />Also, it is quite small. So just read the description carefully before you buy because it really is a small small watch. But I love it exactly that way, I think it looks perfect!, This is a nice looking watch but I had to send it back.  I'm just an average sized person and it made my arm look like a stick.  Way to big for my taste., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, It's a real good watch, with great features (love the snooze).<br />Looks good too with it's low signature overall appearance (no visible markings about this or that).<br />However, that inverse display is awful !<br />Impossible to read the time !<br />With sunglasses in broad daylight - forget it (get your glasses off !)<br />In broad daylight, tilt that watch till you can read something ...<br />In low light, don't even try, just press the illuminator button.<br />Whilst driving the car and just wanting to know what time it is, just look at the car clock.<br />It's a real pity ... because otherwise I love it.<br />It would be perfect if it was as it is with as the only change a normal display (not inverse).<br />Got myself a G-9000-8V which is the same watch, but with a normalish display (orange) and a sand color - very neat and I can at last read the time !, Not sure what I'm more impressed with, the watch or the shipping. Great looking watch,  shipped to Australia in 5 days!, Nice looking watch, large but good looking and comfortable to wear. Very noticeable, love how it looks with included leather bands!, Nice size, fits oversized watches very well.  Attractive looking case!, Watch arrived without tags and was yellowed in color. I bought a new watch, but it looks used. Less than pleased with it., This was the perfect choice for a replacement band for my Samsung Gear Live watch. I did have to notch the pin placement however that was easy the band not only works well it looks good as well. Very happy with this replacement., The metallic material is plastic. I really like the background lighting though, the colors help separate the digits and letters. This has lasted me for almost a year now, even after swimming in pools, running in the rain, and showering. Anyone who wants a waterproof watch for cheap should look at this one., Looks good. Very easy to read even at night. Somewhat larger face than I thought by picture, Incredible watch!  Very high quality and solid.  Looks and feels like a multi-thousand dollar watch.....seriously! Nothing about this watch is cheap. Everything: clasp, band, movements, dials, buttons, detail, even the box.....etc is amazing. Beautiful emblem engraving on the reverse.  Exceptional watch. I wouldn't be surprised to see Jiusko as a top-tier watch seller very soon!, A lot of bang for the buck. I actually used this 24mm strap with adapters for an Apple Watch. Looks great, feels super comfortable. And yes, I'm a watch guy. I have straps that are $400 and ones that are super cheap. This one is a great strap for the money. The more I wear it, the more comfortable it gets, and it keeps it's look., Nice looking watch, but I prefer a watch with a little bigger face. Other than that its great., I like the look of the watch and the fact that I don't need to buy batteries for it and that it is water resistant makes it a good purchase., Seems like a pretty good watch for the price. Have not had it long enough to give a thorough review as far as quality. It is in line with Fossil watches as far as comparison wise. It looks good and is thin, which would work as a dress watch., Metal feels kinda cheap, but watch looks great., Nice looking watch.  A quick wind and it goes for 24 hours.  Keeps great time.  No instructions, so no idea what the other dials or buttons are for, but it tells time so I'm happy.  If and when it quits, I'll look for another., item is beautiful and you will get many compliments but the reason i gave it the rating i did is because the time does run slow, and it looks like there is some specks of dust of something in the actually encasement its self!, I was worried about buying an automatic watch at this price point. I decided to go for it and I’m glad I did. The watch seems well made and mechanically sound. I haven’t had any problems with the watch keeping time. It’s really great for such an affordable automatic watch. I have taken this watch in the ocean, water several times and also, no issues. Seems very solid. I would note, the band is terrible. I replaced it with a nato band it looks great. I would suggest this watch to anyone., Comes as it looks. Not perfect but good for the price., It's a nice looking band (once I finally got the right thing- my order was wrong three times before I got the right product), but the coat of plastic over the top of it is already coming off after 2 weeks or so of wear.  I don't think this will last long.  But it does look good., very military looking and functional, Great watch only had it a couple of weeks but I am satisfied. Looks nice and appears to be durable. This version with the black case and olive leather strap is for casual dress which is what I wanted for work and everyday use. The other styles would be more for dress I think., I have owned this watch for two weeks so far. The watch itself (case and crystal) is very nice and machined well with polished surfaces. It was much thinner than I expected and sits well on the wrist. The bezel does not click and rotates with some effort-- but it looks good enough. The watch face has a nice metallic black finish and some contrast between the middle and outer edges. The lume on the hour markers does not last very long but the lume on the hour and minute hands last through the night (dim).<br /><br />The band is quite cheap and is made of hollow links but is quite comfortable on my wrist and lightweight. I ordered a replacement band when I placed the order.<br /><br />I am still measuring the accuracy of the movement but out of the box it gained approx 4 minutes over 7 days (~34s a day). However, after I opened up the caseback and adjusted the balance the watch is holding time pretty well (still measuring, but I will update).<br /><br />Overall, for the price this watch has tremendous value. I really like the no-nonsense design that works with hydro-static pressure and there is just something about the unique and classic look of this watch. Not to mention the price!, This watch is more impressive in person than just looking at the photos. Very well made mechanical movement, elegant, yet simple retro design with a 40.5mm case. Slightly more than a typical dress watch but not oversized to retain that classy look. The band is a thick leather, embossed with a faux croc pattern that is slightly stiff and needs to be broken in. But it is a quality leather band. If you are looking for a simple but elegant dress watch, I would highly recommend the Bambino, especially at this price!, I love this watch i have ordered about 5 different Invicta watches from Amazon and i have never regreted it. I do struggle with gauging the size of the watch and this one was smaller than expected. It's a more petite feminine style vs the big boyfriend style watches. The only negative thing i can say about it is the mother of pearl looks more like just a white background you have to look very carefully to see some differentiating of color that you could be called mother of pearl. I was a little disappointed with that part only., The watch looks great and seems really well made.  I like the subtle blue hue to the face.  The bracelet snaps very positively and feels secure.  Good heft and size to the watch.  The only thing that knocks a star off is that the hands are hard to see because they are polished and unless the light is hitting them the right way they tend to blend into the face., The watchband is exactly what I was looking for., it was just what I was looking for, fore my wife, I didn't order the pins so I haven't had a chance to attach it to my watch yet but the look and feel of the band seems good.  It's a plain watch band, no designs at all.  the pictures are misleading.  the &#34;designs&#34; are on the underside of the watch band.  when attached, the smooth, plain side is showing.  at first I wasn't happy about that but I think it will be fine.  the texture and materials are perfect tho., GREAT watch for price paid. No issues and looks nice!!, Looks great, the band on the black version actually looks somewhat brown. If you have a small wrist this is not a watch for you, you will have a few inches of extra band sticking out and catching on your shirt and stuff., Its very big but it looks good, Very cheap quality....I should have gone by the price to know how cheap it would be. It is huge on me and I cannot find and pins to remove in order to remove links to make it smaller. For some reason it came with 2 of the same watches...I only ordered one. Although, I do like the way it looks., For the price, looks fine., If you are looking for a basic Casio watch that looks like a G-Shock, but is a more reasonable size, this is the watch to get.  The only reason I returned it is because I was between sizes on the band.  It was either too loose or too tight.  Otherwise, I would have kept it., Comfortable Band, Easy to Wear.<br />I work night time hours outdoors and have been looking for a solid watch that I can see at night and that I can depend on.<br />This watch is Simple, Straightforward, Rugged and Dependable. I almost feel like buying a second one so that if something ever happened to the one I'm wearing that I would have a replacement ready to go.<br />I don't usually give anything a 5 Star Rating....but this Luminox deserves it.<br />Great Piece of Equipment., We bought this as a birthday present for my father-in-law and he loves it! Couldn't stop showing it off.<br />Very well made and does not look cheap which is always my fear with gold tone watches., This watch is more beautiful in person than it is in the picture.  I love the royal blue color.  I love the big face with all the big and small lines for the numbers.  This makes reading time easy which is important to me.  The hands are glow in the dark.  The wristband is skinny making it feminine looking.  By the way it looks, you can tell that it is a good quality watch.  This watch is perfect for me., The band fit my watch LG RW watch perfectly.  It does give the watch a great look to it.<br />I tried to size the band myself but was not successful. I ended up taking the watch and band to a jeweler to have it sized. It cost about $12 money well spent.<br />Mike, The watch looks great and is as described. A bit smaller, than I thought (I actually thought I ordered a female watch).<br /><br />Cons: I do not like the stretchy band aspect. Catches my arm hair a lot, and can be quite painful., This my first ever automatic /mechanical watch that I have owned and so far so good. Great looking watch and the cost did not break the bank. I was somewhat apprehensive not being able to physically see the watch before I purchased it, but the price was favorably discounted compared to prices for same watch at department stores. Overall very please so far., I was not too impressed by the look and feel of this watch. Looks very generic and cheap. I was hoping for a better quality from Seiko - kinda disappointed. But thankful for Amazon's easy return policy - I was able to return it and get a full refund.<br /><br />The dial of the watch is very small. I usually wear a 42mm diameter watches but these are much smaller then the 42mm diameter watches that I have.<br /><br />Sorry Seiko, maybe next time., Ehh, wasn't crazy about this watch at all. Looks very cheap and cheesy but now that I have it seems silly to send it back, Cool watch. Looks more expensive than it is. This watch will look good with dressy clothing., Strap looks better in real life, love the watch itself!!!, Exactly what I was looking for, inexpensive, fast delivery., Great watch for the price. Looks like it cost more. Keeps time very well., I got this as a gift for my husband, and he loved it. It is a very big heavy watch, with a lot of buttons and features, but still looks very nice when he gets dressed up., The look and feel of the watch are all right. I love the hand-wind functionality. I encourage the maker and other watch makers to design and promote more watches that don't need batteries for the sake of our planet. I could be asked to makers of items that could work with energy coming from a hand winded source., Looks nice, but the ticking is really loud.  Edit: the dial broke off after a few months of use. I don't think I was particularly rough with it..., My husband and I got this for our daughter for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it!!  It is so cute and looks even better than the pictures!, Later on I don't know yet.....but right now it,s amazing and like this watch very much....that's I'm looking for they have date,day and month....., Looks good but arrived with dead battery, It looks awesome, but the time changes constantly.  I have to ask my husband to set up the correct time constantly., Not real heavy and the metal makes a kind of thin aluminum sound when it's moved, but it looks nice and for $5, I'd say it's just about perfect., Honestly, I think this is what a Daniel Wellington should cost...<br />Pros: lightweight (forget it's on) and simplistic (easily matches w/anything).<br />Cons: Thinness of whole piece (makes it look a bit cheap), No second hand (Could be a preference, but also makes it look lifeless mad cheap/broken) It just seems like Made in China is written all over it.<br /><br />Reason to buy: this is the best price out there, and the best part of DW is the easily interchangeable straps, I would suggest buying a couple of 20mm Nato straps to add some variety to this purchase ($5-15). Make sure you get rose gold though., it was just what I was looking for, This watch is even better than I'd hoped. Looks amazing and the quality out weighs the value by a great deal. Couldn't be more happier with my purchase. This is my first invicta but can guarantee, won't be my last!, One funky looking watch. Big face. Keeps good time...2 year warrantly., this is really good looking watch and i can give  5 stars just for the look and that it works well..... but there is a big problem with its band.... i just wore it for couple of days and it just teared up......so it deserves 1 star for it.........can not even find a new band to change it..........., Worked as expected and very good quality.<br />It came with spring bars (I did not use them, but it's always good to have a spare)<br />Now, the leather may be a bit stiff at first, but after break in time, it looks and feels very nice!, The SKX series are classic automatic watches and a great value.  These are the Kalashnikovs of the watch world - iconic styling, robust construction, but not terribly accurate.  Expect it to run +/- 10-20s per day and you won't be disappointed.  It can be regulated for much better accuracy - you can also learn to position the watch at night to make up or lose time as you need.  For me, that's part of the fun of an automatic.  It does not hack or wind if that's important for you.  Fit and finish is excellent in my opinion.  The case in particular is beautiful and you can easily trace it's evolution through an interesting lineage of Seiko divers back to the 60s.  My first (SKXA35) is still going strong after 10 years without ever being serviced (FYI it's marked mov't Malaysia same as the SKX173).  Even the Lumibrite lume and Hardlex crystal are like new.<br />I just bought this one for use as a daily 'beater' that isn't bright yellow.  I also really like the square indices, reminiscent of the old 6105 from my era...  The first watch that arrived had a misaligned chapter ring, bad enough my wife and kids could notice, so back it went.  The second watch is much better but not 100% perfectly aligned and the day/date sit low in the their window.  My wife and kids can't see it and think I'm crazy for insisting - so I kept it (but I know...).  For what it's worth, my old SKXA35 was/is perfect.  I don't know if QC has gone down hill or if I just got lucky on that one.  Anyway,  I do recommend buying 'Fulfilled Through Amazon' so you can take advantage of the easy returns if your particular watch doesn't cut it.<br />I might add that these are thickish watches at 13mm but wear well on smaller wrists.  Lug to lug distance is about 45mm, that's pretty short and I feel a better measure of fit on the wrist than diameter (42mm w/o crown).  I have a 6.25&#34; oval wrist and it feels fine and looks natural.  On a Strapcode oyster bracelet it feels wonderful and looks expensive.  On a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment., Looks good and fits great.  It is thin, so I am not sure how durable it is, but it might be that I am used to the canvas style rather than the nylon.  I like how it looks on my Seiko, and will wear it as soon as I replace the battery (in my watch, the strap does not require one)., Bought this watch for my Fiance birthday and he loved it. The watch looks so much better in person. The leather band is very well made and thick. The watch itself is great., Really nice and sleek looking watch. The style and look is very unique and is very durable. This face of the watch looks very chic. Good value for the price. I have made this my every day watch, i wear it to work, a night on the town or a nice wedding it looks good in every situation. It is a very comfortable fit I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a good quality watch. This is already my second tmbr watch purchase and these watches have not given me any issues. Pick one up, you wont regret it., Ilike the look and feel of the watch. it is very easy to operate and I love the auto time setting., This watch looks nice, but it has a nasty tendency to spontaneously stop, because the opening mechanism is at the same location as the time-setting mechanism. I left mine in Philadelphia and didn't feel compelled to go back for it., The Only problem is that the strap band looks inferior and is made of a low quality.<br />I just ordered for a new quality stray band replacement.<br />The band kills the beauty of this time piece., I love this watch!! I wanted something casual but nice and inexpensive. These weekenders take a classic look and make it totally versatile but allowing you to easily switch the bands with different styles/colors. :-), If you're looking for a stylish and heavy-duty watch with an analog readout, check out Swiss Legends.  This watch has the same look as what you would see on James Bond.  Extremely heavy-duty, but stylish at the same time (no laser beams or decoders included that I know of though).<br /><br />I've had a number of watches, but this one is by far the heaviest I've ever owned (not just heavy duty, but it physically weighs a lot).  So if you like the feeling of knowing you have the watch on your arm, then this is a great option.<br /><br />The readout has a lot of settings.  There are stopwatch capabilities, including lap timer, multiple different time zone readout options, and date.<br /><br />It does take a bit of time (no pun intended) to learn how to use this sophisticated watch.  But once you learn the basics, it is fairly intuitive.<br /><br />Be sure you get the chronograph version (unless you enjoy regularly winding the watch, or you're prepping for an EMC and you want a watch that won't stop working).<br /><br />The only notable downside - the many readouts, and the instruction manual, are tiny.  My eyes are starting to go and I can really only read the &#34;big hand, little hand&#34; parts without the aid of eyeglasses.  Even the date is too tiny for me to read without eyeglasses.  So one star removed because of my aging eyes.<br /><br />Also, unless your wrist exactly fits this watch, you'll likely be taking it to a jeweler to get a link or two removed in order to size it for your wrist (but that's the case with any high-end watch)., Metal feels kinda cheap, but watch looks great., hard to set time, etc. Even with the instructions was unable to set it.  Nice looking though, Looks sharp! The face is a bit big for my liking but my husband loves it and it was a great value for a nice &#34;dress watch&#34;., Metal feels kinda cheap, but watch looks great., I love this watch! It's so unique and I've gotten lots of compliments.<br /><br />Initially after ordering, I got a quick email with a shipping confirmation, and received the watch a few days later. It shipped inside a nifty little suede pouch with a button fastener, and I use it as a place to set my watch on my nightstand.  After I got it the first day and did a quick inspection, the watch was flawless with a really nice rose gold finish. The wood dial is stunning with the tmbr logo very tiny and understated. The crown clicks in and out precisely, and overall the watch feels like precision workmanship.<br /><br />The band is nice supple leather that breathes quite well, even when it's humid outside, and the buckle matches the rose gold watch case perfectly.<br /><br />This is all good news, because I'll probably buy another one. After a week of me wearing it, my wife decided she liked it so much that she claimed it for herself.  She has very tiny wrists, but I have to admit it looks great on her, too., It's prank, the worst item I ever bought from Amazon, I got it for my girlfriend on her birthday and withe two months it turns the colors which made me look like s***, wish I could give lower than one star also., I like this watch. It's got a retro look to it. I have a skinny wrist so the band is on nearly the tightest notch, but that's ok. The face is big but not overwhelming and the numbers are clear. The date is hard to read, but hey, I'm retired, so who cares what the date is!, Bought this as a replacement for my hubby's Casio watch. The original band had broken after 6 years of regular use. Perfect fit, and looks great!, Nice looking watch.  It had a little bit of glue on the face when it arrived but I took that off with some nail polish remover.  I just wish it could be adjusted smaller.  My son's arms are kind of scrawny., Looks expensive unail you look up close and realize everything is fake., I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it.  It is delicate and looks good on her.  She is on the small side and<br />it fit perfectly.  I think this is a nice watch for someone that doesn't like the really big ones that seem to be in style now.  This is a classic and<br />will always look great., Movement powered. If I take it off for 1 day, I have to reset it. I bought it for special occasions to look nice. After setting it 4 times, I threw it away. Looks pretty. That's all. I will stick with my G Shock., I've been eyeing some Shinola watches recently but didn't want to drop $600 so I bought this watch, combined it with a light tan leather band (20mm Width Panerai Style Leather Watch Band from JP Leatherworks), and boom, it looks exactly like the $600 watch I've been drooling over. I love the big look of the numbers and the fact that they are luminescent. I've only had it a few weeks so can't comment on its longevity, but in terms of looks, this was perfect for me., It looks wonderful, AWESOME!!!<br />AMAZING!!!!!<br />The watch is unique at its price. Works well,looks so good on wrist,,I've been receiving compliments every day since I have this. It's a really great deal., metal prong on latch broke off after a couple of days.<br />daughter loves the uniqueness of it and we're looking for a different prong to repair it., I love the way it's feel the look it's just right, Looks a knockout! Dials not easy to read, Watch looks great and is a definite eye-catcher except don't plan on getting even a drop of water on it.... ever. I wore it in a light drizzle and somehow moisture got locked inside the display and now the condensation blocks the display and is probably causing damage inside. I will be returning this and probably won't be buying Diesel again. For the price and the claims (water resistant up to 33 feet?) this is not remotely worth it. It's really a shame because this really is a good looking watch., Much bigger than the pictures make it look, and has a very wide band. So if you like that style I recommend it, cause it is very nice. Had a defect in the side so I'm returning it, I have only owned for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to performance quality. Will update if there are any concerns. But, here's so far:<br /><br />Appearance: The design is ***very nice***. Classic lines and dials; the overall look is like a modern twist to a traditional styling - sort of like Kenneth Cole clothing. The buttons are on the left - I've never seen that before. It is very eye-catching, and it is very BIG, but in the gray color (which I have), it's not over-done.<br /><br />Quality: I can't speak for long term performance, but the piece looks and feels like it is excellent, especially for the price. The band is genuine leather, and feels it, while it matches the watch color. Very pleased.<br /><br />Function: mine has kept perfect time so far. The chronograph (stopwatch) actually uses the large second hand, while the actual second hand is the small dial on the left; this is not my preference, but I've had that in a watch before. The numbers are clear and easy to read at a glance. The water resistance is sufficient for anything I plan to do with it on. In other words, splash, etc, but I'd take it off for swimming, showering, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very attractive, easy to read watch., When I got it on my mail box I receive it on a different screen colour. It look nice but it's different than the one I bought, Nice looking watch but arrived damaged. Clasp was broken and the second hand was just floating around. Package may have been dropped or mishandled, but either way something you intend to wear daily shouldn't be so fragile. Doesn't seem to be of any real quality. There are many higher quality watches on Amazon around the same price point., Comfortable, looks nice. Sometimes doesn't clasp and falls off. Great for the price., Great watch! Even better looking in person. Went over well as a birthday gift, very nice looking watch, stylish, thin, the strap is a bit long<br />I wear this watch mostly with business attire, What a find! I needed to replace a water resistant watch that could not be repaired. Also needed good contrast on face to see w/o glasses. Nice looking, great for swimming , face is size of quarter., Great look and feel, clear display, Pretty much as advertised. Bought it to dress up a Timex Weekender and it looks good.  Not a huge fan of the long strap, but, that is the style of these bands., Very dainty watch that looks pretty on my small wrist.  The gold is hardly noticeable as you can see mainly silver unless you look closely.  That's not an issue for me as the watch is very pretty and feminine.  It does not look cheap at all.  It feels very light as well and can easily be worn to dress up or down., Nice looking watch very big love this watch, AS ALWAYS TIMEX COMES THROUGH.  LOOKS GREAT, Right on accurate, MY NURSE WIFE LOVES IT!, I start saying sorry for my english. I buy two of this watch. It is sold by amazon UK at 18£. Amazon don't allow to buy this item from USA to Italy. Recently timex change the name of this watch from atlantis100 to one impersonaly end generical: expedition. that is the name of a line of timex product as iroman,ecc... I prefer atlantis100 because this watch is a sequel of a specific and charaterial model that born with this acquatic name. I love the things that have a story and continuity. A univocal name can give a strong identity,specialistic fashion and plus value to a product. Atlanti100 name strengthened the immagin of this watch in sea and acqua sport scope. Dear timex,was it necessary to change name? You prefer call your watches as expediton t1246322,expedition t63515627,ecc...who are? I know that is difficout and expensive to find a fashion name for mass and economical product models,perhaps your experienc reccomended that it have not sense,but if you have one of them that have just a name,please don't cut it. The custom remember and speak of a product if it have a name,identity and continuity.it is more simply to become best sellers. Anyway Timex brand is a consumer and economic watch producer and they build their watchs in a very good quality standard. The watchs is my passion and i like always looking  for them. in my collection i have a lot of watches, somethings of them stay in a very different expensive level like this but atlantis100 deserves attention because has very special and rare tech spec. it is not simply to find a watch so light and slim that have 100m watet resist limit. The dial of atlantis100 is very '80 fashion,has a sport specialistic and &#34;professional&#34; aspect. the color of display changing if you change the looking inclination.it can appear yellow,green,grey...very,very special. In a first look you can think that the watch is small but it is not true.the dimension is guessed for a watch with essential digital dial,basic functionand that don't want clutter. Who want a very &#34;manly&#34; watch look at other models. The rubber strap is ligth, confortable and frendly to fit. The atlantis100 has all foundamental for a watch:hours,minutes,seconds,day,date,month,alarm,illumination(very good),waterproof(good for acqua sport use)....and plus...timer,stop watch and second time zone. Battery has a very good five years life. The timex atlantis100,with his 30g,is a good partener for summer time,sea activity and sports. It knows get look,it knows get hear (beep),without get feel on wirst. it is a little that can follow you everywere. 18£ are a very nice price for a particolar  and reliable watch like this. You can &#34;fall in love&#34; of it., The watch looks very nice, and the dial has a very clean display, would def recommend., Outstanding watch design. Received many compliments.  Looks far more expensive than it was., I am very happy with this watch. It has what I was looking for., Very cool watch.  Light and good looking, elegant or classy to look at for the price that is unbelievable...will recommend!, I like the fact of a casual watch that is easy to read.  As plus size, It looks good on my wrist - not to small.  On hot, hot days, the band does not irritate my skin.  Well worth the money!, takes a genious to program,which i am not.great looking watch ., Good looking and slick design watch., grest piece looks expensive for price., The watch is classy looking and not very heavy. The teal color is not as pronounced as in the picture. It is more to the navy blue side all the same a  good looking watch.<br />The packing  was appalling.  Watch was out of the box and moving  around freely in a very very large  box because they included  it with another item . There was no packing material  at all. I have to wait and see if the watch continues to work. Four star because  of  the poor packing., The watch was a prime day purchase to get started on Christmas shopping, it arrived and I was so very disappointed, it looks so cheap. Really looks like it came from the dollar store., While searching for a watch display case, I was looking for three main criteria:<br />1 - get my watches off of my bookshelf and into a nice looking case. Check<br />2 - give myself room for a few additional watches (had 5 at the time of purchase). Check<br />3 - don't spend too much money. Check<br /><br />I was not expecting spectacular quality given the price, but I have to say that I am impressed. The glass was scratch free and clean, the case itself was pristine, and the appearance is as advertised. I like to wear larger watches and this case fits them with no problems., This is a very nice strap. Love the contrasting materials. Super well made, and fits perfect. This is a rugged, sporty looking modern band.. Awesome. I've worn it daily for a couple of months now, on my vintage Wittnauer 2000, and it's holding up perfectly. Surely going to last a long time., As a 14 year old who loves to show off, I came across this watch and with about $100 to spend ( 1 day shipping and tax included into that) I decided to purchase this watch. When The Shipment came in the next day, It looked flawless.  The box was perfect and the watch came with everything and even a little more like clothes and a manual.  When I first tried it on,  It wasnt even a close fit.  Unless you are a 280lb 6''4' lumberjack, there is no way this watch is going to fit you without taking out a few links.  I am 5''10' and about 150lbs and it fits perfectly with 1-2 links taken out from each side.  I managed to be able to do this at my house withing like 10 minutes but without the proper experience and equiptment, you probably should take it to a professional to adjust.  After getting the fit, the watch itself looks beautiful.  The 23k gold trim and the blue looks amazing.  Almost exactly like the rolex submariner collection,  but I didnt even buy this to be a copy which is the good thing.  Now every watch has its pros and cons so let me go over those.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Probably the nicest looking watch for under $100 basicly a steal<br /><br />Water resistant up to 200 meters (about 600 feet)<br />you should have no problem taking it to the pool, beach ect.<br /><br />Clasp is nice and gold plating is done nicely<br /><br />Winding and timer feature (manually)<br /><br />Very interesting back of the watch that is transparent<br />so you could see inside<br /><br />This seems a little gimmicky but the glow in the dark feature on this<br />watch is probably the best on any watch.  I am so used to it now.  Just<br />be sure to get it some sunlight or else it wont glow<br /><br />Now with all the pros there are obviously cons.<br /><br />Watch is only gold plated (which is expected for the price) meaning it scratches<br />very easily.<br /><br />Not a self winding watch so it loses I would say about 20-30 seconds a day<br />not a big deal for me but it might be for some people.  I just usually wind it every 2<br />weeks.<br /><br />Very flashy (which is for me a pro) but you might not like that.  I have people approach me from several feet<br />away asking about this watch so if you want to be like a fly on the wall, don't get this.<br /><br />Winding is a little tough but easy after getting used to.<br /><br />For me this watch is a definite buy for someone who wants to make a statement and is looking for an attention seeking watch beacuse trust me, 10s of people will approach you all the time (especially at my age)  It is the nicest watch in this pricepoint but if you are looking for a watch just to tell the time perfectly by the second, then this would not be recomended.  Overall a beautiful watch but it just depends what you like for in a watch<br /><br />Flashy, Pretty, Cool Features= buy<br /><br />Something to tell precise time, not very flashy/not trying to show off= don't buy<br /><br />Overall<br />I would recomemend this watch to about 85% of the people i knowht be for some people.  I just usually wind it every 2<br />weeks.<br /><br />Very flashy (which is for me a pro) but you might not like that.

The face is fairly small, so it looks better if your wrists are a bit thinner. Great for the price., The watch arrived on time. Looks exactly the same as given in the picture. Ordered this as an anniversary gift for my wife and she absolutely loved the rose gold color and look of the watch on her hand. When compared with similar watches, found this one to be a little costlier. Overall happy with the product., Very elegant watch, great looking watch specially the leather band, Ordered this with the intention of using it on rough work days, and saving my other watches for special occasions. Man was I wrong. This is a beautiful and sporty watch. Shows well, feels excellent, and craftsmanship looks to be solid. Buy this watch. Looks very expensive, however, for the price, your receiving a GEM!!!!!......5 stars., The date can be a bit hard to see on my poor old eyes but it keeps perfect time, the band is easy to adjust, and it looks great. Once again delivery from Amazon was prompt and well within its estimate., What a cool unique looking watch! Designed in NYC and only a small number were made. This is one of my favorite digital watches and EVERY SINGLE PERSON that sees it asks where I got it from! It's definitely a conversation stater!, This is a very nice time piece, I actually own a few Armitron Women's watches because there beautiful and well made, can be worn casual, or dressed up a bit and is generally priced very fairly. There is a different style of watch for varying taste. This particular watch is quite nice looking two tone, adjustable links,and water resistant keep good time as has my others. Its a quality watch for a good price and has a versatile look. I like it., Perfect large manly sized watch face (accept no smaller than 50mm!) and manly sized strap. Not as big and crazy like those &#34;gladiator watches&#34; on steroids and not small with a small strap that makes it look like a girls watch. This is what you are looking for. The watch itself is perfectly fine, typical alarm and nightlight features. Nothing special other than large digits if that is also what you are looking for. Great work or sport watch!, The best looking and elegant watch...works perfect and its very precise...i recommend this watch...looks more expensive..!, I bought it as a gift to myself when, after I began my retirement, I would forget the day of the week. With the exception of those rare &#34;dress up&#34; occasions, I wear it all the time even while playing tennis. Works great; looks great. I just wish it had a night light., A VERY solid and well made watch band, we replaced the rubber one that had become old and brittle and WOW the watch looks amazing with the new one., I bring these  watches overseas when I travel to give as a quality gift, and everyone loves them, they look more expensive then they are !!, Its a cheap watch, but it keeps good time. Just wind it EVERY DAY. Looks great!, Stuhrling watch really looking great, beautiful fabrication, reasonable quality with attractive price $59 !!<br />i'm happy to wear this watch while typing my review on it,<br />good finish bracelet, awesome blue degree but numbers on outer ring not so perfectly printed ,<br />hope to sustain by time,<br />i did not test water resist feature; is it anybody have something to say abt that....?, I bought these bands for an Invicta automatic watch.<br />I agree with the reviewer that wrote that these bands look better in person.<br />They are wider and thicker than I anticipated. Very secure and comfortable!<br />What I didn't notice right away is that there are little levers on the bottom side of the bands for installing or detaching these bands.<br />They also look very stylish!<br />These are the nicest bands I have found so far and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again in the future., So far so good. Worn over the weekend and looks great. No issues with clasp unlocking by accident. I have average wrists. Leather looks great. I'll update after a couple months of wear., Beautiful!!! Good watch for the price. Look exactly as shown in the pics. The only thing is, that &#34;you need to wear it at least 10 hours a day&#34; to keep it running..., Item arrived on time and was nicely packaged. It actually looks better than the photos and works very well., So this is a beautiful set. The watch itself is gorgeous. Item arrived on time and are as described by the seller... Well for the most part<br /><br />Some of the bands feel soooooo cheap, even cardboard like. Really really thin and somewhat fragile. However I have used half the bands already and even though they feel cheap they don't look it.<br /><br />All in all a great purchase. If you're looking for robust leather bands however this is not for you., I like the look of the watch. Not crazy about the band, planned on replacing it before I bought it. Difficult to see day and date, easy to read time. Good quality for the price I paid., I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves it. So far every thing is good the watch looks nice and working fine., I don't get the great review at all.  I understand it is a cheap watch, but it really looks the part.  Flimsy band and tiny watch face.  For the price it isn't terrible, but I was expecting more based on the reviews., I got this watch as a gift for my wife, and she loved it. It's a good quality watch, and it has a really good look and feel to it, Link band quality is very bad watch looks good., Looks lighter in person, got it for a nice price so that's there, It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., These are great straps for the money. I have a few other deBeer watch bands.. Never disappointed. The contrasting white stitching looks pretty sporty on my Harley &#34;FatBoy&#34; watch from 1993.. Perfect match!, this is much bigger than it looks online but i always wanted a sporty analog watch and i really love this..also feels really durable, Very nice look and feel, Holding up well, I just wish the band loop was stitched in place (I'll take it to local shoe shop)<br />as it keeps moving around.  Looks good and the price was great., Awesome Watch!! Great price and looks amazing. Loses about 3-5 seconds a day with normal wear. Try to calibrate it once a month or so., Nice watch. Well built. No problem in the shower, pool or sailing the open seas. On par with any 51% Swiss made automatic. The Amphibian was too small for my wrist so my wife took it and it looks absolutely fantastic on her. I will buy other Vostok watches in the future. The only thing I found annoying was the branding. There is none. Some have the &#34;b&#34; Vostok logo while others do not. The graphics vary from watch to watch. These watches would be far more valuable if Vostok developed a consistent branding policy and stuck to it., Nice looking watch. Seems to run a bit smaller in length. My other silicon watches have more elasticity to them. Overall, I'm pleased., I like it its a great nice looking watch with an expensive look and materials, I absolutely love my new watch which is far more beautiful than even pictured.  It is amazing to wear for any event and very dressy looking much more expensive than the cost., looks really great and invicta products are awesome..really looking forward to coasting this around the place!!!, Very attractive watch. Looks expensive, but isn't., Excellent time piece. Keeps perfect time. Great look. Gets lots of compliments. The only negative is the trijicon is not as bright as I anticipated., I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. He loves it! It looks way more expensive than it was. He gets compliments on it all the time. It holds time well, as long is you wear it consistently., This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke when I found I could not get it to run but I looked at the stem and found I could not pull it out to set it,after looking at 2 or 3 times I was able to see a small piece of plastic wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. .My wife just loves it I also got her the Gold one as well . My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., The watch looks great, but it runs slow. Once a week I have to set the time cause it is 30- 40 minutes (!) behind. I would give the watch 4 stars but if it isn't measuring time accurately it fails it's purpose., Nice looking automatic watch, it look like it should cost more then what it does., For those looking for a more affordable alternative to a designer watch, this looks like a good choice. My daughter wanted a watch that looked like my $6300 ceramic one, and this fit the bill. Since a 15-year-old doesn't need to have that kind of money on her wrist, a look alike for $75 seemed like a good idea. The watch is really beautiful, and the ceramic band and dial remind me very much of my more expensive watch. The bezel turns nicely and the face is very attractive.<br /><br />Now the bad news: To begin with, the crown popped out like it's spring loaded and it won't pop back in. I though it might be a screw down crown, but it's not. It will pop back into place, and then immediately pop back out again. Which means, whenever it's being worn, it will catch on things and pull the crown all the way out and basically stop the watch. I have tried and tried to get that crown to stay in, but no dice. Adjusting the band was also a nightmare. The two piece pins connect in a space so tiny I had to purchase a band adjusting set to fit the pin hole. The crown is really the problem though. I realize it's only a $75 watch, but for that money I expected the crown to stay down!, Very nice, good looking and a quality product. Instructions could be better, but the product is grat, Nice looking watch, however, it took longer than specified in the instructions to get enough of an initial charge for the watch to operate and keep accurate time., Watch was too heavy returned it.  Looks nice., Looks good, but the works are terribly off time, must constantly adjust it. Might have a watchmaker look at it., Very pleased with the High-Fashion look of this watch.  Price and value is unbeatable., This watch was much better than I anticipated because I'm not the biggest fan of the band style but after readjusting it to fit my wrist it looks great. I wear it semi-regularly, would recommend it if you're interested., Keeps great time. Clean look. Resistant to scratching., Compared to a lot watches I own this watch feels cheaply made. I'm used to a much heavier watch but if you're looking for a lightweight watch then you might enjoy this watch., The watch is a great looking watch... but it HUGE ! (see pictures)  Perhaps I have a small wrist, but this thing spans almost the width of my wrist.  Also, as you can see by the pictures, I have changed the band.  The leather band that comes with it is nice, but here again, it's huge also.  The tongue (the part that hangs out past the buckle part), hung out so far it was annoying because it caught on everything. Here again, perhaps my wrist is small, but this strap was much larger than any other watch I have purchased.  Again, I like the look of the watch, its a great looking watch, but I feel like a rapper with bling on when I wear it. The new band I bought ((Amazon)Hadley Roma MB3805Y) matches great, and I think adds to the great look of the watch, and its a much better fit also.  This will not be my daily go-to watch, but I'll wear it once in a while, as it's more of a conversation piece rather than an everyday wrist watch., great looking band....originally thought it was going to have a gold buckle as seen in the picture but it came with silver...however the seller did send me a gold one andI am very happy...THANK YOU, Nice watch, looks good with business casual dress code...., Looks nice, seems durable and easy to switch out., Impeccable function and looks along with accuracy. Haven't bought this watch from amazon but this piece comes highly recommended. The hands may look out of place being coated white and not steel or glossy and maybe an initial let down. Fits as a right size on medium sized hands and looks bigger than its 40mm., This watch is amazing!  It looks and runs great!, It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., For a watch it is good like all Timex watches. However the watch I received from Amazon is not the one pictured here which has a medium brown and and nearly white markers and hands. The combination in the picture is very sharp looking it is not what was delivered. What I received was a different color combination of much lighter color brown band and pale yellow hands which has much less visual impact. The one I actually got is OK but does not look like the one in the picture. If it had looked as it was presented I would have given it two additional stars., Splendid watch.  Looks much more sumptuous in-person than in the picture.  Check online auctions for lower prices., This Invicta watch is a sporty stand out.  It fits my slender wrist well, works well and looks good.  The time and date are easy to set, unlike some Invictas, which can be a challenge.  Love it!, The watch arrived on Sunday....so that was a surprise! The Box was of high quality the watch looks great the band is a little light a tad flimsy but i have to remember it was $60.00 i would buy it again. Like a good pair of jeans you can dress it up or down and you'll look good in it., As described. Nice, cheap way to change the look of my watch..., Love it! The transparent inner ring makes the clock look as if it was custom colored for my office; blends in wonderfully! Suspect this would work with virtually any wall color.  Plus, constant second hand sweep; no ticking., Really nice looking watch.  The atomic auto set function works great.  No setting and time is always correct., Very classy and expensive looking. These pics don't really do it justice. I  was going to buy a couple of other designer  watches to add to my collection. I have an Armani watch that I love dearly, a silver And platinum Rolex that is a gift from my father, but this watch is clearly now my favorite watch. As a matter of fact, I will not be buying anymore watches for now. I brought a brown, a white and yellow  bands to switch things up a bit. . It feels  now  like I have several expensive watches.The silver face goes with any color band to match your outfit. I saved a ton of money  just buy buying different bands and a spring bar tool to change these bands in less than 10 secs. Love it, I never wore watches because they would feel to tight or my wrist or just look odd but I decided to try it again and thought I would get a cheaper watch first. I love this watch, it's not too tight, it looks fabulous, and it can really take a beating! I am not a gentle person and this watch has not yet scratched and I've worn it every day for three plus weeks so far! Someone I know who has a $100 arch has scratches all over theirs and is jealous of mine! If you want a classy watch that will get you compliments every day you wear it get this one!, This watch looks gorgeus. A bit heavy, but not more than more traditional watches of this size. Mechanism is silent. Built quality is more than enough for its price. Color is bright light cupper, a bit similar to golden, but not (it's more discrete). Beware: this model is the only one without luminiscent effect in the dark, from the Eclipse serie., I was looking  for a watch with a large diameter face. Not something crazy like some of those you see that look like they are on steroids, but a manly size face with a manly sized strap (typical ones seem to have a small face and strap so it seems more like a girls watch). So I came to learn that I am looking for 50mm diameter size in the description to satisfy my 'look'. As far a the watch itself, yeah, standard digital watch with alarms and face light up at night features. It's the look that sold me., [[ASIN:B00S0D9J74 Bessky® Luxury Fashion Crocodile Faux Leather Mens Analog Watch Watches]] In reality it looks inferior than what it looks in the picture. But what am I complaining about. I only paid $3.60. So what the hack, I give it four stars., This was actually a gift for one of my good friends- the look on her face when she opened it was priceless!, A nice band, on the darker side of stainless, more titanium looking...just so you know what to expect., This watch is exceptionally  light, color blue is very  bright . The size is perfect. Nice looking.  Fun piece., I Love the watch the color, band the look the way it fits the Invicta is a watch tha i will be buying for<br />myself and my family, THANK INVICTA great price SEE YOU SOON!!!!, my first dress watch, received quite a few compliments, looks like an expensive one, Perfect, it what exactly what i was looking for, Man, love this watch. OUTSTANDING. for the price your paying. It's a gem. Looks almost like a Bell&Ross, except, you don't have to pay the extra thousands of dollars. Maybe later on, the real one will come into play. For now, very happy with this watch. Looks extremely well. Well built, and arrived in a nice watch box.....Buy it. What are you waiting for?, IF you have a Space Grey Apple Watch Sport， I highly reconmend this one . The black one matches the gray Apple watch almost perfect.<br />At first , I worried that for this low price the band might look and feel &#34;cheap&#34; but it's quite the opposite.The adapter is really easy to swap out with sport band allowing me make the watch dressy or more casual based on the occasion.<br />The buyer also ship to me the band removal tool which helps me to shoten the length of the watch band., Really neat for the price, a lot better quality than I expected. Works great.... Alittle trouble with learning how to set, but you can look it up online. All-in- all very nice. ME and my son bought one each., First let me say that the accuracy of this watch is nothing short of amazing! I own several (read TOO many!) Swiss and Japanese watches and this ranks right up there with them.<br /><br />However,I gave this watch 4 stars because it is rather bland for the price (about $250.00 on Amazon).  In fact, I have some Timex watches that look more expensive.  I find it hard to believe that full retail is around $400-$450.  The blue second hand and domed mineral crystal are nice touches but the polished and buffed stainless steel look somewhat cheap next to them.  The black strap, however, is very nice and soft.  I do think for the price a sapphire crystal would be in order.  I would even pay a little more for It.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do like the watch and am happy to have an Accutron II in my collection.  Love the sweeping second hand.  Looks like an automatic without the winding!  And again, the 96B213 is incredibly accurate.  You won't miss any meetings with this watch., I don't like it at all in person.  Looks online ate very deceiving.  It has a very small face, and the material looks cheap.  I'm very disappointed.  I have purchased many watches online never had a problem.  This is awful!, I'm wearing this instead of my Tag Heuer-- even for summer swimming & beach because my tag battery is more exp. to replace than this whole watch and this looks as nice if not nicer., Keeps decent time. Is cat-themed. Not too expensive.  Just what I was after. The watch face is faceted: the highest point is in the center, and then the clear cover slopes away from the center in pie-wedge shapes towards the outer circle of the face. Sort of like the roof of a circular tent. It looks fine, but it can throw the reflection a bit. If you look at the image, you'll notice the light shining on the face is in a Pie-chart-wedge-shape. That is the shape of the cover. It isn't a problem, but it takes a little bit to get used to it., The design is amazing I love it but the watch is very very small, I bought it for me but I'm not going to use it, because it looks like a women's watch, I just wasted my money, This is a very beautiful, sturdy looking watch. But don't buy on looks alone. This is surprisingly delicate for a mechanical watch. The winding mechanism provides little to no resistance, making it very easy to over wind the spring and break the watch. Looks great as a prop piece, but you must be careful if you are to use it on a daily basis., First, this is a well made watch.  Second, the picture doesn't do it justice, it's a great look with a heavy feel.  Third, be aware it is larger than I expected!<br /><br />The box and watch itself is very nice.  I worry when choosing gifts that the item might arrive in a cheap package and no matter the price it will make it feel cheap.  This is not the case.  The box and instructions, watch, tag etc. are very nice-an expensive feel.  I love that, especially when choosing gifts.<br /><br />The watch is well built, or at least at this point that is how I feel.  It is heavy and feels durable.  The buttons/knobs at the side of the watch are easy to use, even for larger hands.  The face is huge and easy to read.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this, just be aware it is larger than you might assume!, Great looking watch for the price.  Fits an active lifestyle.  Only negative is face is dark so sometimes hard to see time and watch functions., Beautiful watch that can be worn as a dressy rugged look or can be worn for everyday wear.  I had so many compliments on it from women in the office.  They were looking for a women's version of the watch (smaller face)., The exterior of the case is of good quality.  The interior of mine was in shambles, the cardboard partitions were all knocked down most likely do to shipping.  I was able to reassemble it and seems to be holding up well for now.  The huge disappointment, and the reason for the 2 stars, for me is that the &#34;removable pillows&#34; are missing.  Without the pillows the watches just flop to the bottom and look messy.  The photos show it with pillows and the description says &#34;with removable pillows.  To not include them is wrong.<br /><br />Thank you,, nice little watch. 4 star for the watch and 5 star for the services. Really nice no question ask. Recommend for buyer who want something reasonable price with a cool & good looking watch., I was looking for a Velcro band for the watch but I got this awesome watch for this price totally worth it...\n",

I would have loved a 30 or 90 second option in there, but honestly i cant complain. i have nicer digital watches, but this is my go to., Love it\n",

            "I really like this watch. It has a great face that contrasts nicely with the white numerals. Keeps time accurately. Overall very pleased. I really like its distinctive look. It's also durable and water proof. I leave it on when I go kayaking or out on the boat fishing., I like the watch!  I had its predecessor and enjoyed it until all the numbers started to fall off.  Hope that does not happen to this one.  The numbers run together it's sometimes difficult to distinguish the time.  I'm adjusting to it.  Like the new clasp., These were purchased for my daughter and her friend, but I liked them enough that I kept one for myself as well!, My husband like it but he would have liked the dial face to be a little smaller. He is not used to the bigger face but getting used to it. The picture product was hard to tell about the dial face and don't think it mention about the dial face being bigger than normal. Besides that everything else is really well made., The size and thickness is Huge. the color is eye Popping.The band is durable and ridged . the only problem I have is that it doesn't glow to mush in the dark. but I like it, I bought surprised watch  gift for my daughter. It's beautiful and nice color. She really likes it., Didn't like, I like it!!, I like it, I was looking for a Seiko for my husband.  He likes it.  Wish the face was glow in the dark but other than that it fits the bill., The wife likes it n she's happy with the watch, Just like in the picture but the textured dial isn't as shiny as you think it is but still shiny., like them., Nice time piece. Keeps precise time and is sturdy to wear daily. Not super big like some., Seems like a nice watch and easy to read. Still unraveling the connection with the Seafire; now that I have the watch, I looked on-line at a Seafire's instrument panel and specifically the clock, the face doesn't really look like this at all. By the way, this is the stiffest leather watch strap I have ever encountered, hopefully that bodes well to longevity., bangles seem like they wont last, but im watching closely, Great product...5 star for quality... 5 star for being, and looking like the pic. This watch is sturdy and has lasted longer than any of the cheap plastic watches I've usually purchased in the past. I am typically the destroyer of watches because of my job but this one is still going strong and that is a lot to say for someone like me who usually breaks them in about a month. You won't be disappointed with this one!, I had a watch just like this but it was blue and the rubber broke and I liked the style and brand so much that I bought another in my favorite color. It is waterproof to a certain deep depth and the packaging confirms that. Has a speed timer, an alarm, a secondary time as well as the normal time and day month and year., Like the style, Like it, like them., Husband likes it., Band was scratched and looks like someone tried to fix it with a sharpie..., I like the large number display its easy for me to see at night and for the money it's a pretty good value compared to other brands I like it., My daughter loves it. When I asked her if there was anything she liked/didn't like about it she said &#34;I like that it has butterflies, but I don't like that they don't come to live and play with me.&#34;<br /><br />So there you go, perfect watch unless you're a 6-year-old with unrealistic expectations., i dont like it, Really I'm surprised  it's a such wonderful watch from timex I liked this model is unique and stylish, I love this tiny watch since I like black and it's very delicate. Suitable for little bit thin wrist., I love it! It's like a rolex but it's invicta., I like it very much \u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a, I like the watch.  Had to take it to a jeweler to have it sized, as we couldn't find a screw driver small enough to remove the screws.  The watch is very comfortable and easy to read., What a nice and simple watch. after adjustment my wife like to were it out when we cruise, The wife likes the watch, it was a good deal...----, Excellent watch if you like the colors. Whether or not you like it will probably depend on personal preference really. But the material is fantastic!, If you are anything like me, you have been looking at some of the Casio Protrek watches, like the PRG-270 or PRW-3000.  No doubt, sweet looking watches with tons of great features.  However, those watches are either too big or too expensive, or both.<br /><br />Enter the SGW-100.  Almost the same features as its more expensive siblings, but at a fraction of the cost.  Also, the size is much more reasonable.  Not too big (and ridiculous), not too small.  And it has a real backlight, not the weak 1980's amber LED light that shines from the bottom left corner, like too many lower price Casio's., This watch was enormous on my wrist. I will be returning it. I like the looks of the watch quite a lot, but just too big,, I had purchased one of these last year, but had dropped it and cracked the crystal. I liked the watch, sturdy but not large and thick like many pro divers. However, when I ordered another recently it came with a dead battery and I sent it back. That process went smoothly, but I decided to go another route., Great watch. Like the large face. Directions need to be somewhat more explicit., This watch SMELLS so bad you can not even wear it! Stinks like mildew. It looks ok but wasted my money on it because the smell is atrocious., Looks and feels like a fake watch, But if you want to keep your watch looking like it has original parts, just spring for it.<br />I like the the watch, but the design isn't made for everyday., The watch is fine.  I'm okay with it.  It's pretty much what I expected it to be, but it is NOT red.  The one color I cannot wear it with is red - which I have a lot of in my wardrobe.  The color is more like salmon.  There is pink in it.  Just disappointed in the color, but will keep the watch.  I like the watch., not for me but if you like a large watch face it is a nice watch, Product not as described - bezel is black not gunmetal like the face.  I live overseas and due to postage costs this is too cheap a watch to bother returning, but disappointed I didn't get what I paid for., This is my second G shock and it's really a cool one. It's a little more expensive than the main line of Gshocks but it more than makes up for it with its appearance. As others have said here, the colors are not pure orange and blue, but a tad washed out. The Japanese special edition has more vibrant color. I knew this before hand and chose this version as I think the colors stand out enough already to the point where you can't avoid seeing it and to go further would be a little obnoxious. It's big and colorful so it works well in places like dark bars, clubs, or anywhere else at night that isn't very dressy. The yellow roller on the side is a little overpowering on the watch but it adds a little childish character to the watch. It looks like something out of a cartoon or perhaps a nerf produce or a late 80s, early 90s watch. I will wear this over my Rolex when I'm out at night just because the colors can keep. Good buy and will easily last at least a decade like most Gshocks do., I bought this watch May of 2013 to use before my deployment with the army to Afghanistan. This watch is still going strong. It also looks great; not too big like some other G- Shocks I've been, and it looks more subtle than the others, which I like. I don't like the other flashy looking ones.  My younger brother is in need of a watch for cross country and am buying this one once again. Great watch, I highly recommend it!, I absolutely love this watch. I don't like that the battery died a month after I bought it., very comfortable nice fit goes with everything really glad I purchased like it a lot, It's just like in the picture but would have appreciated if they offered wrist sizing, I like the style and fit but the clasp is installed backwards, it makes it difficult to clasp yourself so you have the have the made in china face outwards instead of Akribos., She likes the appearances, the fit and the feel time will tell if it's a fantastic watch., I've had itcsbout a month now & like it.  It was just as represented, is attractive and keeping good tome., It's OK,very pretty. It it much too large for me to wear, but would look lovely if you like BIG watches., I like it!!, I really like it!!! I can't say anything bad about it...yet ( I have it for a week ), Gave this as a gift and she liked it., Can't read the display due to glare. Seems like it's  from the high viz green face cause I have never had this problem on other g shocks., Nice, unique, and eye catching. Good quality, really like it!, Distinctive, sturdily made clock. Brass numbers and map face can be adjusted to your liking. Easy to read face. Keeps good time., Invictas. Good watches for those who like larger faces., Like it so much great buy !!! Wow over this watch !!!!, Like the weight and style.  Getting the links changed was a snap with the right repairman., Great watch and seems like a quality build.  However, the screen is not as bright as I had hoped for.  Maybe they didn't design it to be as bright as I would like, or maybe my eyes are not as young as they used to be, although I am only 41.  I wear it at the gym to time the time between sets.  Since the gym is quite brightly lit, the lighting function is of no used.  Bottom line: good quality watch, but the contrast of the numbers to background is too low to be usable for me.  It's like trying to read from one of the early versions of the Kindle.  Just my opinion though.  Hope that helps someone., The watch is bigger than I expected. However, I like large watches as I'm a tall guy I'm very impressed. The watch gives the classy look of analog and the modern conveniences of a digital watch., Looks and feels like PVC. Cheap and nasty., Like it a lot!, I had one of these 15 years ago and it seems like it isn't made now with the same quality as it once was.  I had this watch for 3 days before it broke.  I loved my old camper, but these aren't made the same, This boy's watch is perfect for that age where kids really want grown-up things, but destroy them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />It has that Otterbox type of nubby, chunky look. Kids that like to figure out settings will really get a kick out of this.<br />Friends have a child on the autism spectrum that loves fussing with multi-function watches, and the grandparents gave him an expensive verion of this watch.<br />He was thrilled, and it engaged him for hours on end.<br />Then, naturally, it broke and of course lost all appeal.<br />This is the perfect watch for kids like my friend's.<br /><br />And remember, tomboy girls love watches like this!<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted.<br />Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.<br />After six months, most review products are donated, destroyed or returned to the vendor. Nonprofits are encouraged to inquire., This is a very nice watch. I wear watch's instead of bracelets so I have many. The finish on this watch looks really nice sort of like a brushed gold. One thing I like is the little heavier weight of the chain. I did receive this watch at a discount for giving a review but  I really like it., i like it, I like this style...I love my watch, I have one in blue too.  Fit ok, even when are<br />big, Thin like a piece of a paper. The leather smells like it's been dipped into a tub with chemicals., I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />While I do like the look of this piece overall, I do have a couple complaints. The area where the leather pieces gather at the ends, attaching to the braided part, are white. I would've liked it better if there was a cap or the ends were colored the same so it's not as distracting. Also, the watch part doesn't doesn't stay in the center, it slides down towards the bottom. However, this watch/bracelet is soft and doesn't pinch or have any rough spots. It's not stiff where it's uncomfortable to wear and the charms are firmly attached. The watch is also very quiet, making the ticking sound not annoying at all., Very nice quality and feel.  It's held up for quite awhile.  There's definitely a thickness that you won't find in all watch bands, but I like it very much., Very cute. Great if you like large watches., I like it, The Watch is too big... how can I take some of the links off? The watch seems like it will strip, not good. Not happy about my order, They look decent in her wrist being petite and 5ft tall. Large face and bright. She wears it often and likes it., I got this one but with red digits.I like it so much I bought the one with blue digits. I have not got it yet but my friend like mine so much he bought one with the blue digits and he loves it.and I think its a great watch and if you like led watches like I like led watches you will loves your too&#62; I highly recomend this watch, I like the way it looks, and its just really nice, Really cute watch that goes with everything.Is large though but if you need cheater glasses like me then large is the way to go.don't need the glasses to see the face of this watch., I really like it with my apple watch, it high quality leather with a nice shiny stainless steel buckle, here is photos with the apple watch., like it .., I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, I like the watch a lot and recommend it.  But you should know that it's often hard to read in low light., I like this watch a lot, largely because it was a gift from my mother.  One thing is that the vendor could have sent a little instruction sheet about how to change the band., I like a lot. I recommend it., I own several Android watches and love them all. They keep good time and make quite a statement on your wrist. I like big watches and this one is 40mm square., I got this watch at W..M..t because they did a price match.  All my coworkers have &#34;shock&#34; watches, so I went full lemming.  I've never liked the layout of Casio (because I'm so accustomed to the functions of the timex/ironman), and I don't like the bulkiness and busy face of the G-Shock.  I've had it for a day now, and it's going well.  I am an ironman watch loyalist, and I've only had one lemon in my life.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what it takes to take full advantage for &#34;shock&#34; because my non-shocks seem to take a regular beating with no issue.<br /><br />PRO: It's not overly bulky and it fits my smaller wrist well because it still feels light.<br /><br />CON: I wish it had the same OI as the non-shocks.  I don't understand why I can't have three alarms (it has one), and three time zones (shock capable of two)<br /><br />CON: Unlike the non-shocks, the glass is a bit more raised, which then casts a shadow over the display.  Before I could just glance at my non-shock, but now I have to tilt my wrist.<br /><br />I'm not a watch snob, and I haven't made any investments in watches.  One day I'd like to get a few so that I can pass them down., Loved it!! Perfect watch. It looked just like the picture! I'm super happy with this purchase!, The girl I gave it to said She likes it., Arrived on time and is really a nice watch.Large face and easy read numbers and really who doesn't like Mickey Mouse., I bought this for my daughter who just started running on her HS cross country team.  She likes the style and it is very easy to use.  Nice product., My husband bought this for me as a gift before starting my internship.  It's a nice watch and the opal finish on the face is beautiful.  I have small wrists and generally like smaller/slender bracelets and watches.  This one fits nicely, not too bulky and easy to read., I like this little alarm clock. Got it right next to my bed., Good simple watch. Would like it better if the side buttons were recessed so they wouldn't get pushed by objects I am handling, The watch is more yellow color than I would have liked but it fits well and works. It did not look like the picture in my opinion which was a lighter gold color.  I have since purchased another slim style gold watch that I prefer to wear instead of this one.  It is still a nice watch just a bit off in color for my taste anyway., Really like the look and function. Good value., I bought this for my husband, at first I didn't like it and was worried he wouldn't either. It seemed so huge and excessive with the gold finish. But after looking at it again I really like it now. It fits well on my husband's wrist - not too big at all - and he is very pleased too.., Bday gift for my son.  He likes it..hopefully its durable enough for military life., I like the watch. It's big enough to read without my glasses. My only disappointment was that the pink color I see on my computer is not the same pink as the actual watch. The watch is a darker pink. No biggie but I would have preferred the color in the picture which is a brighter pink., I have extremely small wrists so I had to remove several links.  After removing all the links that I could the watch sill did not fit snugly,  but it's a satisfactory fit for me.  It looks more like a bracelet as the band is a bit wide on my small wrists, but I like that effect.  It is elegant so I would not recommend for everyday wear., I'm very satisfied. This watch is cute AND inexpensive. Just like in the picture. I do wish it had gotten here a bit quicker, but it did come on time., I like the watch nice looking, Unfortunatelly I didn't like it. I wanted it for  my Swiss Legend watch and it was too much different quality., i like it, I was told the recipient liked it, I have small wrists so I had to take some links out but I really like the watch., I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, This one i liked.\n",
